Below are some of the ways I aim to increase and adopt EDI values within this research group:\n\nI strongly encourage and support student and trainee applications from underrepresented and equity-deserving groups for all positions, including BIPOC, persons with disabilities, women, and 2SLGBTQ+.\nI document and ensure equitable access to training, development, and mentoring opportunities for all students and trainees.\nI promote and encourage EDI-related training opportunities for all team members (e.g., addressing and reducing unconscious bias, microaggressions, anti-racism).\nI aim to foster proactive inclusion of all team members by promoting a safe, respectful, and supportive work environment that is responsive to diverse situations, needs, and accommodations.\nI continuously strive to improve my understanding of and actions within the research group aimed at addressing and mitigating systemic academic and research barriers faced by those from different underrepresented groups."
