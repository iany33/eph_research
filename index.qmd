This research group, led by **Dr. Ian Young** of the School of Occupational and Public Health at Toronto Metropolitan University, is focused on **reducing the environmental public health burden of food-borne, water-borne and zoonotic diseases**. To address this aim, a variety of research methods are used, including epidemiology, applied statistical modelling, mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative approaches), and knowledge synthesis (e.g. systematic reviews, meta-analysis). The main objectives of the research group include:

-   Identifying and synthesizing key research needs and gaps

-   Understanding the prevalence and use of health protection behaviours of different population and stakeholder groups, including key drivers and determinants of behaviour change

-   Identifying and evaluating key strategies and interventions to modify or change the behaviours of individuals and organizations

-   Evaluating the epidemiology of and control measures to prevent food-borne, water-borne, and zoonotic diseases
