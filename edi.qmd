## Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Statement

I am deeply committed to creating and ensuring an equitable, diverse, and inclusive environment for all students, trainees, and collaborators in the research group. Below are some of the ways I aim to increase and adopt EDI values within this research group:

-   I strongly encourage and support student and trainee applications from underrepresented and equity-deserving groups for all positions, including BIPOC, persons with disabilities, women, and 2SLGBTQ+.

-   I document and ensure equitable access to training, development, and mentoring opportunities for all students and trainees.

-   I promote and encourage EDI-related training opportunities for all team members (e.g., addressing and reducing unconscious bias, microaggressions, anti-racism).

-   I aim to foster proactive inclusion of all team members by promoting a safe, respectful, and supportive work environment that is responsive to diverse situations, needs, and accommodations.

-   I continuously strive to improve my understanding of and actions within the research group aimed at addressing and mitigating systemic academic and research barriers faced by those from different underrepresented groups.
