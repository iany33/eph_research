  abstract = {Food handlers can put the public's health at risk if they lack food safety knowledge. From March to June of 2015, 197 Canadian TrainCan Inc. foodhandler certification students participated in a food safety survey to assess their knowledge at 1, 3 or 5 years post food handler certification. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify and evaluate demographic variables associated with average knowledge scores. The survey consisted of 27 questions and had a response rate of 8.7\%, with an average score of 88\%. Participants showed a lack of knowledge on questions regarding reheating potentially hazardous foods, the manual dishwashing procedure and proper sanitary food storage. Multivariable logistic regression modelling identified a significant association (P {$<$} 0.05) of average food safety knowledge survey scores to education level, years lived in Canada, and years worked in the food service industry, with the relationship to gender being borderline significant. Regular food safety retraining between recertification courses is advocated for food handlers, to maintain their food safety knowledge and awareness, so as to ensure safe food for consumers.},

Risk-assessment tools that are simple and easily applied can provide public health practitioners with objective evaluations of the risk of West Nile virus (WNV) activity in their jurisdiction. This study was conducted to evaluate an existing WNV risk-assessment tool used by a public health unit in southern Ontario. The purpose of this study was to: (i) describe the trends for WNV in mosquito and human cases in the Region of Peel, Ontario, Canada, and (ii) investigate the ability of the risk-assessment tool to predict positive human cases and positive mosquito traps in the following weeks. Data were collected from 2011 to 2016 and analysed using simple descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact tests. This study found the tool includes variables that are not significant in predicting WNV activity in the following weeks. The current tool should be revised to remove variables that are not significant in predicting risk and add additional variables that have been shown to be effective predictors in other studies, such as rainfall and human WNV cases in the previous year.},

Regression models were constructed using inspection data from a health unit in Ontario, Canada, to measure the effect of certification on premise inspection results. We found that premises without certified food handlers at the time of inspection were significantly more likely to fail inspections. The odds of inspection failure were significantly different depending on the premise's cultural cuisine classification. Independently owned establishments had lower odds of inspection failure versus chain operations. Inspector was a significant random effect explaining a small percentage of data variations. These results support the use of food handler certification to improve food safety outcomes at establishments. Further efforts should ensure training programs are accessible and relatable to premise operators, particularly those serving all types of cultural cuisines.},

  abstract = {Recently, attention to chikungunya has increased due to its spread into previously non-endemic areas. Since there is no available treatment or vaccine, most intervention strategies focus on mosquito bite prevention and mosquito control, which require community involvement to be successful. Thus, our objective was to systematically review the global primary literature on the risk perceptions, attitudes, and knowledge of chikungunya among the public and health professionals to inform future research and improve our understanding on which intervention strategies are likely to be successful. Potentially relevant articles were identified through a standardized systematic review (SR) process consisting of the following steps: comprehensive search strategy in seven databases (Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, CAB, LILACS, Agricola, and Cochrane) and a grey literature search of public health organizations, relevance screening, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction. Two independent reviewers performed each step. Reporting of this SR follows PRISMA reporting guidelines. Thirty-seven relevant articles were identified. The majority of the articles were published since 2011 (83.8\%) and reported on studies conducted in Asia (48.7\%) and the Indian Ocean Islands (24.3\%). The results were separated into four categories: general knowledge and perceptions on chikungunya; perceptions on the risk and severity of chikungunya; knowledge of chikungunya-harboring vectors and transmission; and knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes on mitigation practices. Overall, the systematic review found that risk perceptions, attitudes, and knowledge of chikungunya among the public and health professionals vary across populations and countries and knowledge is higher in areas that have experienced an outbreak. The results suggest that most of the affected populations in this study do not understand mosquito borne diseases or chikungunya and are therefore less likely to protect themselves from mosquito bites. While more research is required to improve the generalizability of this dataset, it appears that a lack of knowledge is an important barrier for motivating community level interventions and personal protection against mosquitoes.},

This cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the food safety information-seeking preferences and practices of young adults who use Reddit, a popular community-based website. A questionnaire was developed, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model and Theory of Planned Behavior, and distributed online to young adults (aged 18-39 years) from October 2019 to January 2020. Predictors of participants' intentions to use Reddit to search for advice about safe food handling in the following two weeks were assessed in an ordinal regression model. Eligible responses were obtained from 209 individuals. One-third (36\%) of respondents had previously searched for food safety information on Reddit, 88\% of which adopted the advice they found. Self-reported food handling practices were generally positive, but only 50\% of respondents owned a food thermometer. Respondents were more likely to intend to search for food safety advice on Reddit if they perceived the website to be useful and credible, if they previously searched Reddit for food safety information, and if they perceived safe food handling to be unpleasant. Additional education and outreach strategies targeting this website are warranted to ensure accurate food safety advice is promoted online.},

A scoping review of published research was prioritized to identify and characterize the scientific evidence concerning key aspects of LD to support public health efforts. Prior to initiation of this review, an expert advisory group was surveyed to solicit insight on priority topics and scope. A pre-tested search strategy implemented in eight databases (updated September 2016) captured relevant research. Pre-tested screening and data characterization forms were completed by two independent reviewers and descriptive analysis was conducted to identify topic areas with solid evidence and knowledge gaps. Of 19,353 records screened, 2,258 relevant articles were included in the review under the following six public health focus areas: a) surveillance/monitoring in North America (n=809); b) evaluation of diagnostic tests (n=736); c) risk factors (n=545); d) public health interventions (n=205); e) public knowledge, attitudes and/or perceptions in North America (n=202); and f) the economic burden of LD or cost-benefit of interventions (n=32). The majority of research investigated Borrelia burgdorferi (n=1,664), humans (n=1,154) and Ixodes scapularis (n=459). Sufficient research was identified for potential systematic reviews in four topic areas: a) accuracy of diagnostic tests; b) risk factors for human illness; c) efficacy of LD intervention strategies; and d) prevalence and/or incidence of LD in humans or B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in vertebrate reservoirs or ticks in North America. Future primary research could focus on closing knowledge gaps, such as the role of less studied vertebrate reservoirs in the transmission cycle. Results of this scoping review can be used to quickly identify and summarize relevant research pertaining to specific questions about LD or B. burgdorferi sensu lato in humans, vertebrate hosts or vectors, providing evidence-informed information within timelines that are conducive for public health decision-making.},

A thematic analysis was conducted using the Theoretical Domains Framework as a coding guide. A total of 42 consumers participated across seven focus groups. The most notable changes in behaviors were seen in participants' hand washing, sanitation, and grocery shopping practices. Participants tended to perceive grocery store employees, shoppers, and foodservice staff as having inadequate sanitation precautions and therefore as a source of COVID-19 transmission risk. They heavily relied on public health, medical, and government officials as sources of information. Feelings of stress and anxiety appeared to be linked to certain sanitation behaviors. Many participants displayed a general apathy toward routine food safety practices, such as safe food storage at home. This research supports the need for clear and concise messaging for safe food handling during the COVID-19 pandemic and in future times of crisis.},

To support real-time notifications of water quality, models using environmental variables have been created to predict indicator bacteria levels on the day of sampling. We conducted a systematic review of predictive models of fecal indicator bacteria at freshwater recreational sites in temperate climates to identify and describe the existing approaches, trends, and their performance to inform beach water management policies. We conducted a comprehensive search strategy, including five databases and grey literature, screened abstracts for relevance, and extracted data using structured forms. Data were descriptively summarized. A total of 53 relevant studies were identified. Most studies (n = 44, 83\%) were conducted in the United States and evaluated water quality using E. coli as fecal indicator bacteria (n = 46, 87\%). Studies were primarily conducted in lakes (n = 40, 75\%) compared to rivers (n = 13, 25\%). The most commonly reported predictive model-building method was multiple linear regression (n = 37, 70\%). Frequently used predictors in best-fitting models included rainfall (n = 39, 74\%), turbidity (n = 31, 58\%), wave height (n = 24, 45\%), and wind speed and direction (n = 25, 47\%, and n = 23, 43\%, respectively).

Limitations identifed by risk-of-bias assessment included not validating models (n = 21, 40\%), limited reporting of whether modelling assumptions were met (n = 40, 75\%), and lack of reporting on handling of missing data (n = 37, 70\%). Additional research is warranted on the utility and accuracy of more advanced predictive modelling methods, such as Bayesian networks and artificial neural networks, which were investigated in comparatively fewer studies and creating risk of bias tools for non-medical predictive modelling.},

The virus, endemic to parts of Asia and Africa, has recently undergone an emergence in other parts of the world where it was previously not found including Indian Ocean Islands, Europe, the Western Pacific and the Americas. There is no vaccine against chikungunya virus, which means that prevention and mitigation rely on personal protective measures and community level interventions including vector control. Methodology/Principal findings A systematic review (SR) was conducted to summarize the literature on individual and community mitigation and control measures and their effectiveness. From a scoping review of the global literature on chikungunya, there were 91 articles that investigated mitigation or control strategies identified at the individual or community level. Of these, 81 were confirmed as relevant and included in this SR. The majority of the research was published since 2010 (76.5\%) and was conducted in Asia (39.5\%). Cross sectional studies were the most common study design (36.6\%). Mitigation measures were placed into six categories: behavioural protective measures, insecticide use, public education, control of blood and blood products, biological vector control and quarantine of infected individuals. The effectiveness of various mitigation measures was rarely evaluated and outcomes were rarely quantitative, making it difficult to summarize results across studies and between mitigation strategies. Meta-analysis of the proportion of individuals engaging in various mitigation measures indicates habitat removal is the most common measure used, which may demonstrate the effectiveness of public education campaigns aimed at reducing standing water. Conclusions/Significance Further research with appropriate and consistent outcome measurements are required in order to determine which mitigation measures, or combination of mitigation measures, are the most effective at protecting against exposure to chikungunya virus.},

  abstract = {Background: Norovirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in Canada. The illness causes great morbidity and high societal costs. The objective of this article is to describe the epidemiology of norovirus in the province of Ontario, Canada from 2009 to 2014. Methods: To assess activity of norovirus and viral gastroenteritis (VGE) in Ontario, three datasets were acquired from the provincial government: two traditional surveillance datasets (outbreak and laboratory) and syndromic surveillance data (telehealth), all spanning 2009\textendash 2014. All outbreaks, laboratory submissions and telehealth calls were first assessed for total VGE. Norovirus and norovirus-like illness totals were calculated as a proportion of VGE to estimate agent-specific activity levels. Affected institution types, sexes and age groups were also analyzed. Results: Between 2009 and 2014, 41.5\% of VGE outbreaks, 63.4\% of VGE laboratory submissions and 36.6\% of all acute gastroenteritis-related (not restricted to viral causes) telehealth calls were attributed to norovirus and norovirus-like illness in Ontario. The most commonly affected institution type was long-term care homes and the most commonly affected age groups were younger (younger than five years) and older (older than 65 years) individuals. Females were slightly more frequently affected than males. Conclusion: Norovirus and norovirus-like illnesses were the leading cause of VGE in Ontario between 2009 and 2014. They comprised the greatest percentage of VGE when compared with all other VGE-associated viruses. Additional work is needed to determine all component costs and necessary public health actions to reduce the burden of disease.},

  abstract = {Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused several major epidemics globally over the last two decades and is quickly expanding into new areas. Although this mosquito-borne disease is self-limiting and is not associated with high mortality, it can lead to severe, chronic and disabling arthritis, thereby posing a heavy burden to healthcare systems. The two main vectors for CHIKV are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito); however, many other mosquito species have been described as competent CHIKV vectors in scientific literature. With climate change, globalization and unfettered urban planning affecting many areas, CHIKV poses a significant public health risk to many countries. A scoping review was conducted to collate and categorize all pertinent information gleaned from published scientific literature on a priori defined aspects of CHIKV and its competent vectors. After developing a sensitive and specific search algorithm for the research question, seven databases were searched and data was extracted from 1920 relevant articles. Results show that CHIKV research is reported predominantly in areas after major epidemics have occurred. There has been an upsurge in CHIKV publications since 2011, especially after first reports of CHIKV emergence in the Americas. A list of hosts and vectors that could potentially be involved in the sylvatic and urban transmission cycles of CHIKV has been compiled in this scoping review. In addition, a repository of CHIKV mutations associated with evolutionary fitness and adaptation has been created by compiling and characterizing these genetic variants as reported in scientific literature.},

Instructions on storing leftovers were provided for 4.0\% of recipes (n = 31), 55\% of which (n = 17) correctly corresponded to government guidelines. The lack of food safety messages on popular recipe blogs shows that efforts are needed to encourage bloggers to promote safe food handling to consumers.},

This study included a descriptive analysis, mapping, and identification of geo-spatial clustering patterns and hot spots of 2017/2018 restaurant inspection results (pass, conditional pass/ closed) obtained from Toronto's public disclosure system. Negative binomial regression modeling was conducted to identify associations between census demographic information and the rate of conditional pass/closed outcomes. Of 5,950 first annual restaurant inspections performed in 2017, 5,510 (92.6\%) restaurants passed, 438 (7.4\%) attained a conditional pass, and 2 (0.03\%) were closed. Of 6,457 first annual restaurant inspections in 2018, 5,907 (91.5\%) restaurants passed, 540 (8.4\%) attained a conditional pass, and 10 (0.15\%) were closed. The Global Moran's I statistic showed positive and significant spatial autocorrelation (P {$<$} 0.01) of conditional pass/closed counts and percentages in both years. Additional hot spot analyses identified four and three census tract clusters in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Census-tract information on low-income households, immigration status, and non-official languages spoken at home were associated with rates of conditional pass/closed inspection outcomes. The findings provide insights into spatial characteristics of results of food premise inspections, which can inform food safety policy and practice.},

Therefore, an investigation of their safe food storage practices is important to help prevent food-borne illness in this population. This research seeks to evaluate the food safety knowledge, attitudes and practices related to food storage and refrigeration among undergraduate students at a university campus. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional study was conducted by administering a questionnaire to undergraduate students (n = 93) living in two residence halls on a university campus. Findings Many respondents (43.3 percent) were unaware of the maximum temperature a refrigerator should be set at to prevent microbial growth, while 83.7 percent reported `never' or `rarely' checking the temperature of their refrigerator using a thermometer. Many respondents (43.1 percent) incorrectly `agreed' or `strongly agreed' that the smell and appearance of food can be used as an indicator for food safety, and 64.1 percent self-reported often or always using this practice. Respondents that were born outside of Canada had more positive food storage attitudes, while those that identified as Caucasian had higher knowledge scores. A positive correlation was identified between knowledge and attitude scores (r = 0.217) but neither were significantly associated with practice scores. Originality/value The study revealed gaps in the knowledge, attitudes and practices of university students living in residence halls related to safe food storage. Hence, there is a need to increase awareness and education in this population on key food storage practices.},

  abstract = {Young children are at greater risk of foodborne illness than adults. They are affected more severely due to low stomach acid production, immature immune systems, lower body weight, and lack of control over their meal preparation. Consequently, foodborne illness disproportionately affects children, with the highest incident rate among those less than five years of age. Our goal was to synthesize evidence of food safety knowledge and behaviour of parents/caregivers who regularly prepare meals for young children at home. A comprehensive search strategy was conducted using six databases to identify relevant articles published between 1994 and 2021. Articles were screened for relevance and characterized, data extracted, and articles assessed for risk of bias. Meta-analysis of comparable outcomes was used to estimate the trend across studies. Meta-regression was conducted to explain possible sources of variability. Forty-six relevant articles were included in the meta-analysis, and there was high heterogeneity across studies and outcomes. Knowledge and behaviour gaps included participants' knowledge and use of food thermometers to check cooking doneness. Parents/caregivers across studies had high knowledge of handwashing (median prevalence of 95\%, IQR~=~90\textendash 97\%, n~=~8 studies) and practices related to discarding leftovers after 2 or more hours at room temperature (median~=~85\%, IQR~=~84\textendash 91\%, n~=~5 studies). Meta-regression results showed studies conducted in low-middle-income countries (vs. high-income countries) were more likely to report a lower prevalence of time-temperature control knowledge ({$\beta~$}=~-0.25; 95\%CI~=~-0.50, -0.03; I2~=~98.75\%; adj R2~=~29.3\%; n~=~11 studies) and practices related to cleaning kitchen utensils before and after meal preparation ({$\beta~$}=~-0.28; 95\%CI~=~-0.53, -0.03; I2~=~98.83\%; adj R2~=~18.23\%; n~=~18). Studies using self-reported behaviour measures (vs. in-person observation) tended to report a higher prevalence of handwashing with soap after handling raw meat ({$\beta~$}=~0.48, 95\%CI~=~0.23, 0.74; I2~=~98.34\%; adj R2~=~52\%; n~=~14). This review highlights the need for food safety interventions to target knowledge and behaviour gaps for parents of young children. Research gaps were also identified, including investigating other high-risk food consumption (e.g., cookie dough and sprout) and applying behavioural change theories to address this population's barriers to safe food handling.},

This limits the use of infrared thermometers for food safety compliance, as they show only the surface temperature of foods. This research examined the relationship between the internal temperature of hot-held foods measured via a probe thermometer and the surface temperature measured via an infrared thermometer in a retail setting. Seven different food items in hot holding stations at seven different retail stores were examined on six occasions for probe and infrared temperatures. The data were analyzed descriptively, and a multivariable linear mixed-effects model (controlling for store location as a random effect) was developed to determine the predictive relationship of infrared to probe thermometer measurements. A strong correlation was identified between the two measurements (r = 0.706; n = 212). The regression model indicated that the infrared temperature significantly predicted the probe temperature, and this relationship differed by food type. The minimum infrared thermometer temperature needed to predict a probe temperature of {$\geq$} 60\textdegree C, with 95\% confidence, ranged from 53\textdegree C for whole chicken to 62\textdegree C for chicken strips. These results can be used to inform temperature compliance monitoring for hot-held foods.},

We examined the relationship between specific environmental factors and E. coli concentration in recreational beaches in the Niagara Region. We analysed E. coli geometric means collected from eight beaches from two of the Great Lakes in the Niagara Region in Ontario, between 2011 and 2019. We applied path analysis to evaluate the relationship between the environmental factors and E. coli concentrations, including whether effects were direct or indirect via a mediator. Turbidity was found to be an important mediator for the indirect effect of environmental variables overall and in beach-specific models. Rainfall and streamflow had a positive indirect effect on E. coli via turbidity and a direct effect in five out of seven beach models. Streamflow was also a mediator for the indirect effect of previous day air temperature in five out of seven models. In three subset models, outfall E. coli concentration was a mediator for the effect of the environmental factors. Using a novel methodological approach, this study identifies important relationships and pathways that predict beach E. coli concentration in freshwater beaches located on two of the Great Lakes.},

This study linked environmental data to E. coli geometric means collected at 18 beaches in Toronto (2008\&ndash;2019) and the Niagara Region (2011\&ndash;2019) to examine the environmental predictors of E. coli. We developed region-specific models using mixed effects models to examine E. coli as a continuous variable and recommended thresholds of E. coli concentration (100 CFU/100 mL and 200 CFU/100 mL). Substantial clustering of E. coli values at the beach level was observed in Toronto, while minimal clustering was seen in Niagara, suggesting an important beach-specific effect in Toronto beaches. Air temperature and turbidity (measured directly or visually observed) were positively associated with E. coli in all models in both regions. In Toronto, waterfowl counts, rainfall, stream discharge and water temperature were positively associated with E. coli levels, while solar irradiance and water level were negatively associated. In Niagara, wave height and water level had a positive association with E. coli, while rainfall was negatively associated. The differences in regional models suggest the importance of a region-specific approach to addressing beach water quality. The results can guide beach monitoring and management practices, including predictive modelling.},

Frequency tabulations were used to analyze close-ended survey responses, and both a conventional content analysis and thematic analysis were conducted on open-ended responses. A total of 80 eligible survey responses were received. Most respondents were located in Ontario (53.8\%). Study results revealed that EPHPs have faced incidents of harassment, frustration from the public, and a lack of support from management. These matters ultimately challenged the well-being of EPHPs, placing them at increased risk of burnout, stress, and fear. Thus, it is crucial that support for mental health and reporting systems is improved for the future to ensure that EPHPs are able to meet the demands of their work. Further studies should be conducted to examine the lived experiences of EPHPs and barriers faced in more detail, including possible strategies to improve their working environments and well-being.},

The objective of this qualitative study was to apply the Theoretical Domains Framework to explore factors which influence hand hygiene among young adults aged 18 to 25\,years old. An online questionnaire (n\,=\,37) and thematic analysis were used to generate 3 overarching themes. The main findings indicated internal factors such as knowledge and intentions; interpersonal factors such as social norms; and environmental factors such as reminders, cues, accessibility, and cleanliness of handwashing facilities determined the level of hand hygiene practiced among young adults. The findings suggest that behavior change techniques such as social comparisons and tailored messaging to suit the needs of young adults may be more effective at increasing hand hygiene.},

Design/methodology/approach-An online structured questionnaire was developed and administered to older adults (60+). Two behavioural intention outcomes were investigated: thawing meats safely and storing leftovers within recommended guidelines. The survey instrument measured socio-demographic and TPB variables: attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and intentions. A measure of self-reported habitual behaviour was also recorded and used to determine whether past practice influenced behavioural intentions. Findings-Respondents (n = 78) demonstrated good intentions to safely defrost meats and store leftovers. The models accounted for 41 and 48 per cent of the variance in intentions to perform safe storage behaviours. Attitudes and subjective norms were predictors of intentions to safely thaw meats. Habitual behaviour was a significant predictor of behavioural intentions to safely store leftovers. Perceived behavioural control was a significant predictor of intentions to thaw meats and store leftovers. Research limitations/implications-The sample size was small, and results are to be interpreted with caution. Practical implications-The results indicate that theory-based solutions to solving food safety among consumers may be a feasible strategy. Originality/value-The study is the first of its kind to apply the TPB to this consumer group.},

Data from seniors across Canada (n = 1078) were collected in 2014-2015, using a population-based, structured telephone survey. Three safe food-handling outcomes and nine determinants were examined, using logistic regression models. Most participants were women (66\%) and lived with others (51\%). Most seniors followed instructions on food labels (90\%) and refrigerated leftovers within recommended guidelines (82\%), but only a small proportion of respondent's stored raw meats on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator (20\%). Models revealed that women and younger seniors (65-74) were more likely than men and older seniors to have better food handling outcomes. Recommendations are provided based on these findings to improve targeted messaging and highlight areas for future research among seniors.},

Objective: To explore user perceptions and identify potential directions for PAIFOD and make recommendations for databases with food safety information. Methods: Between January and March 2020, 16 semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 24 previous, current and potential PAIFOD users. Interviewees were asked about their knowledge of and experience of using PAIFOD as well as about its strengths and limitations and recommendations for the database. An inductive thematic analysis approach was used to analyze qualitative data and generate themes. Results: Four main themes were generated based on the 24 interviewees' accounts of their experience with and recommendations for PAIFOD: participants viewed PAIFOD as a useful tool; they weren't familiar with its contents or purpose; they stated it should become an open-access platform or linked with another information-sharing initiative; and they considered that PAIFOD had the potential to enhance the Agency's reputation by becoming widely recognized and used. Conclusion: This work, along with the ever-changing landscape of foodborne surveillance, supports the need to ensure that PAIFOD is updated to meet the modern-day demands of food safety experts.},

However, there are concerns about varying levels of vaccination coverage of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines among those working in healthcare. The aim of this study was to identify barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations among healthcare providers and trainees using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Methods: Semi-structured interviews (n = 18) were carried out with healthcare providers and trainees in Canada. A thematic analysis approach was used to code interview transcripts and match findings to TDF domains and broader categories. Results: Three overarching themes were generated from six TDF domains and three inductively generated categories: (1) making informed health decisions with an added responsibility to protect oneself and patients; (2) a pro-vaccine social network, widespread accessibility, and pursuing a sense of normalcy; and (3) seeking a more nuanced, respectful, and calculated approach to vaccine communication and policy implementation. Conclusion: These findings help to identify factors associated with influenza and COVID-19 vaccine uptake among individuals in the healthcare field. Addressing these factors may improve healthcare provider sentiments surrounding vaccines, lead to better patient education, and increased uptake of vaccinations with the potential for seasonal booster doses.

Many qualitative research studies have been conducted to examine food handlers' opinions, perspectives, and experiences with safe food handling in an effort to understand the factors associated with their use of such practices. The aim of this systematic review was a synthesis of the findings from relevant studies to identify the main across-study themes and develop recommendations for interventions and future research. The following steps used to conduct the review were developed a priori as part of the study protocol: a comprehensive search strategy; relevance screening of abstracts; relevance confirmation of articles; study quality assessment; data extraction; thematic synthesis of results; and quality-of-evidence assessment. We identified 28 relevant articles reporting on 26 unique studies. Behavioural determinants were grouped according to constructs from the Theoretical Domain Framework, and further mapped onto the COM-B model of the Behaviour Change Wheel. A total of 13 categories of determinants of safe food handling were identified. Of these categories, overall confidence ratings were assigned and rated as high (n = 9) and moderate (n = 4). The analysis revealed that: 1) food handlers typically demonstrated good knowledge and had positive attitudes toward training; 2) environmental factors (e.g. policies, resources), reinforcement (e.g. posters, reminders), emotions (e.g. stress), and social influences played a significant role in food handlers' intentions and practices; 3) food handlers were confident in their abilities and showed positive beliefs relating to consequences of unsafe food handling; 4) they demonstrated a lack of motivation to perform safe food handling practices and experienced lapses in concentration; and 5) culturally diverse food handlers had unique barriers such as language and communication. Areas for future research and recommendations for policy and practice are discussed.},

Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of lean fish or fish-derived protein on serum/plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels by conducting a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data sources: Medline (Ovid), Scopus, CINAHL, and Food and Nutritional Sciences databases were searched from the start date of each database to September 2019 to identify RCTs determining the effect of lean fish on lipid profile. Study selection included: RCTs investigated lean fish and fish-derived proteins intake and determined at least 1 major lipid or lipoprotein measurement. Data extraction: Two reviewers independently evaluated 1217 studies against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Relevant studies were assessed for risks of bias, and random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to generate average estimates of effect. Results: A total of 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of data from 18 to 21 eligible crossover and parallel-design RCTs with a total of 1392 to 1456 participants found triacylglycerol-lowering effects for lean fish compared with no fish consumption. Lean fish intake showed no significant differences related to total cholesterol or lipoprotein levels. Subanalysis showed that parallel-group RCTs tended to find greater reduction effects on circulating triacylglycerol than did crossover RCTs. Conclusion: Additional better-designed, longer, and larger RCTs, particularly crossover RCTs, are needed to clarify the impact of lean fish and fish proteins on the serum/plasma lipid profile. Findings from such studies would enable practitioners to provide their patients evidence-based recommendations to meet the American Heart Association guidelines for fish consumption to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.},

Therefore, we conducted a study to analyze produce washing messaging in YouTube videos posted during, compared to prior to, the COVID-19 pandemic. Videos were identified via targeted keyword searches. Produce washing methods were coded and classified according to government recommendations. A total of 100 YouTube videos were identified and analyzed; 66 videos were posted during the pandemic and 34 before the pandemic. Of the 100 videos, 70 contained nonfactual information about produce washing. Videos posted by bloggers were more likely to contain nonfactual information compared to videos posted by the government and organizations (78 versus 29\%). Videos posted during the pandemic were more likely to have nonfactual information than those posted before the pandemic (56 versus 17\%). This study found that individual bloggers contributed to the spread of misinformation about produce washing in YouTube videos, resulting in potentially harmful behavior changes among consumers.

A limited number of human case reports have described severe illness. CVV infection has been associated with outbreaks of congenital defects in small ruminants in Canada and the United States. A scoping review was conducted to identify, characterize and summarize research on CVV, and to identify research gaps. A structured search was conducted in eight electronic databases, with additional search verification and grey literature investigation. All captured studies were independently appraised by two reviewers for relevance and data characterization. The review captured 143 relevant studies investigating CVV epidemiology (n = 104), pathogenesis (n = 37), viral characteristics (n = 24), transmission (n = 14), diagnostic test performance (n = 8) and mitigation strategies (n = 2). Evidence of CVV infection was found in mosquito studies (n = 47), and serological evidence of exposure was demonstrated in animals (n = 41), as well as human (n = 20) studies. In sheep, five outbreaks of birth defects following asymptomatic dam CVV infection during the first 50 days of pregnancy were reported. Only six human cases of CVV-associated illness were captured, with case symptoms described as initially non-specific, progressing to more severe clinical signs (e.g., meningitis). No research was identified investigating treatment, societal knowledge and risk perception, economic burden or predictive models related to the impact of climate change on CVV. CVV circulates in mosquito and animal species across a large area of the Americas. Small ruminants are the only animals in which CVV-associated clinical disease has been extensively studied. It is likely that human cases are under-reported or misdiagnosed. Future research should focus on the impact of CVV infection in human and animal populations.},

The only intervention captured by the review which was significantly associated with reduced risk of Salmonella in field settings, was elimination of lairage, which is not currently feasible commercially. The logistic regression model for fecal Salmonella shedding in pigs with a random intercept for trial yielded the following predictors significantly associated with increased odds of infection: oral challenge route relative to intra-nasal, log increase in challenge dose, and elapsed time post-challenge. Univariable exact logistic regression modeling lymph node contamination post-challenge yielded the following predictors significantly associated with increased odds of Salmonella infection: younger animals relative to older ones; intra-nasal challenge route relative to oral route; and animals sampled within the first 7days post-challenge relative to those sampled at 14 or 21days. We hypothesize that the presence of absence of one or more of these predictors across studies could help to explain the inconsistent and/or non-significant findings reported for some interventions applied at lairage.},

  abstract = {Background Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has commonly been associated with large waterborne outbreaks of human jaundice in endemic areas but it has been increasingly recognised as a cause of sporadic human cases of jaundice in non-endemic areas, in individuals with no history of travel. Zoonotic exposure is widely hypothesized to be an important potential transmission route in these sporadic human cases. Serosurveys conducted to determine the frequency of HEV human exposure report wide ranges in prevalence across studies and locations. Our study objective was to compute meta-analysis summary estimates of human seroprevalence of HEV IgG within countries considered HEV non-endemic, where possible, and to determine whether this varied significantly across these countries, as well as investigating the role of potential HEV seroprevalence predictors such as population age structure. Materials and methods A broad literature search was conducted in six electronic databases. Citations were appraised, and relevant data extracted using forms designed and pre-tested a priori. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted in R, with HEV IgG seroprevalence in blood donors or the general population being the outcome of interest, and country, assay, population age and sex structure, and chronological time investigated as predictors of the outcome. Results From 4163 unique citations initially captured, data were extracted from 135 studies investigating HEV serology in blood donors or the general population, of 31 countries among those categorised as `very high human development' by the United Nations. Country of sampling and assay employed were consistently significant predictors of HEV IgG seroprevalence with chronological time being a non-significant predictor in the dataset of captured studies. Conclusions While country of sampling and assay employed were significant predictors of HEV seroprevalence, comparison of HEV seroprevalence across non-endemic countries is hampered by the lack of a gold standard assay and uncertainty regarding residual bias across studies, as well as regional differences within some countries.},

  abstract = {Pork is one of the major food sources of human salmonellosis worldwide, and beef products have been implicated in numerous foodborne outbreaks. Thus, effective interventions to reduce Salmonella contamination during beef and pork processing are of interest to both regulators and the meat industry. We conducted a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of literature investigating the efficacy of slaughter and processing interventions to control Salmonella in beef and pork. Review steps included a comprehensive search strategy, relevance screening of abstracts, relevance confirmation of articles, data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment, meta-analysis (where appropriate), and a weight-of-evidence assessment. A total of 191 relevant experimental studies were identified. The results of two controlled trials indicated that hot water and steam treatments were effective for reducing the prevalence of Salmonella on beef carcasses (relative risk [RR]= 0.11; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02, 0.58), whereas in four trials, prechill organic acid washes were effective for reducing Salmonella on pork carcasses (RR = 0.32; 95\% CI: 0.13, 0.78), with high confidence in the estimates of effect. In four quasi-experimental studies, postexsanguination chemical washes were effective for reducing the prevalence of Salmonella on cattle hides, with low confidence in the specific estimate of effect; however, moderate confidence was found for the effect estimates of scalding (RR = 0.20; 95\% CI: 0.14, 0.29) and singeing (RR = 0.34; 95\% CI: 0.22, 0.52) of pork carcasses. The overall evidence supports enhanced reductions of Salmonella through a multihurdle approach. Various slaughter and processing interventions can contribute to reduction of Salmonella on beef and pork carcasses, depending on the context of application, and an appropriate combination should be selected, validated, and verified by establishment operators under their local conditions.},

  abstract = {Foodborne illness has a substantial health and economic burden on society, and most cases are believed to be due to unsafe food handling practices at home. Several qualitative research studies have been conducted to investigate consumers' perspectives, opinions, and experiences with safe food handling at home, and these studies provide insights into the underlying barriers and facilitators affecting their safe food handling behaviours. We conducted a systematic review of previously published qualitative studies in this area to synthesize the main across-study themes and to develop recommendations for future consumer interventions and research. The review was conducted using the following steps: comprehensive search strategy; relevance screening of abstracts; relevance confirmation of articles; study quality assessment; thematic synthesis of the results; and quality-of-evidence assessment. A total of 39 relevant articles reporting on 37 unique qualitative studies were identified. Twenty-one barriers and 10 facilitators to safe food handling were identified, grouped across six descriptive themes: confidence and perceived risk; knowledge-behaviour gap; habits and heuristics; practical and lifestyle constraints; food preferences; and societal and social influences. Our overall confidence that each barrier and facilitator represents the phenomenon of interest was rated as high (n = 11), moderate (11), and low (9). Overarching analytical themes included: 1) safe food handling behaviours occur as part of a complex interaction of everyday consumer practices and habituation; 2) most consumers are not concerned about food safety and are generally not motivated to change their behaviours based on new knowledge about food safety risks; and 3) consumers are amenable to changing their safe food handling habits through relevant social pressures. Key implications and recommendations for research, policy and practice are discussed.},

Adequate hygienic behaviours among bathers are important to reduce these risks. However, prior studies have found low compliance with pre-swim showering and avoidance of urinating in pools. We conducted a mixed-methods analysis of online discussion comments to identify key determinants of these two behaviours. We identified relevant discussion threads on Reddit, Quora, and swimming forums. Identified comments were classified as having a positive or negative sentiment towards the behaviour, and they were thematically analyzed according to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). We analyzed 986 comments from 45 threads; 49.8\% of comments were classified as expressing a positive sentiment towards the behaviour. Positive sentiments were more commonly expressed towards pre-swim showering compared to avoidance of urinating in pools (60.1 vs. 47.1\%). Eleven themes were identified across the following eight TDF domains: beliefs about consequences (n=362 comments), social influences (n=298), beliefs about capabilities (n=240), social/professional role and identity (n=144), knowledge (n=138), emotions (n=137), reinforcement (n=78), and environmental context and resources (n=33). Results can help to inform targeted educational and outreach strategies with bathers to encourage increased adoption of hygienic behaviours.},

A cross-sectional survey study was conducted to investigate the sociodemographic and psychosocial determinants of the reported use of these behaviors among Canadians. A questionnaire was developed, guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework, and pre-tested through 10 cognitive interviews. The questionnaire was administered in English and French on November 18, 2019, to an online panel of 524 Canadian consumers. Logistic and ordinal regression models were constructed to evaluate determinants of consumers' reported thermometer ownership (yes/no) and thermometer use and poultry washing frequencies (each measured on a 5-point Likert scale). Nearly two-thirds of respondents (64\%; n=333) reported owning a food thermometer. Thermometer ownership was more common among males (odds ratio [OR]=1.48, 95\% CI=1.02, 2.15) and those with higher income categories. Nearly 45\% of these respondents (n=147) reported often or always using their thermometer to check cooking doneness. The frequency of engaging in this behavior was best determined by four psychosocial constructs: behavioral intentions, beliefs about consequences, self-efficacy, and habits. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (64\%; n=333) reported often or always washing their poultry before cooking it. This behavior was more frequently reported by males (OR=1.51, 95\% CI=1.002, 2.28). It was also predicted by six psychosocial constructs: behavioral intentions, beliefs about consequences, self-efficacy, social influences, social responsibility, and habits. Habits had the largest influence on both behaviors. The study results can inform the development of more targeted food safety education and outreach initiatives to improve these behaviors among Canadians.},

We conducted a comprehensive systematic review to identify, characterize, and synthesize global studies in this area to determine the overall effectiveness of these interventions. The review focused on experimental studies with an independent control group. Review methods included structured search strategy, relevance screening of identified abstracts, characterization of relevant articles, risk of bias assessment, data extraction, meta-analysis of intervention effectiveness for four outcome categories (attitudes, knowledge, behavior, and food premise inspection scores), and a quality of evidence assessment. We identified 18 relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 29 nonrandomized trials. Among RCTs, 25 (64\%) unique outcomes were rated as high risk of bias, primarily owing to concerns about outcome measurement methods, while 45 (98\%) nonrandomized trial outcomes were rated as serious risk of bias, primarily because of concerns about confounding bias. High confidence was identified for the effect of training and education interventions to improve food handler knowledge outcomes in eight RCT studies (standardized mean difference = 0.92; 95\% confidence interval: 0.03, 1.81; I 2 = 86\%). For all other outcomes, no significant effect was identified. In contrast, nonrandomized trials identified a statistically significant positive intervention effect for all outcome types, but confidence in these findings was very low due to possible confounding and other biases. Results indicate that food safety training and education interventions are effective to improve food handler knowledge, but more evidence is needed on strategies to improve behavior change.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the food safety behaviours of farmers' market vendors in the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario, Canada, to identify possible food safety risks and areas for future education and training. The food safety behaviours of vendors selling time-temperature control for safety (TCS) foods were observed throughout 2018 at 60 markets. Observations were conducted discretely and recorded on a standardized form via a smartphone. Data were descriptively analysed, and two selected outcomes were evaluated in multivariable logistic regression models. Prepared foods (50\%) were the most commonly sold type of TCS food product among all observed vendors (n = 454). While general cleanliness and sanitation was very high, 27\% of vendors did not provide cross-contamination protection methods for at least some of their TCS foods. Similarly, 66\% and 48\% of vendors who sold foods requiring cold and hot holding (n = 410 and 162, respectively) did not provide temperature control for at least some of their foods. Cold-holding temperature control was more commonly observed among vendors selling raw meat, poultry, and fish, and less commonly observed among those selling ready-to-eat meats; fresh-cut leafy green vegetables, tomatoes, and melons; and cheese and dairy products. A mean of 4.55 (SD = 2.62) behaviours requiring handwashing was observed per vendor across 1356 customer transactions, but only 2.9\% of vendors attempted handwashing. Most vendors handled food with their bare hands on at least one occasion (79\%); this behaviour was more commonly observed at weekend markets and among vendors engaged in multiple roles, and less commonly observed among vendors selling prepared foods. The study results have identified targeted areas for future food safety education and training with farmers' markets vendors in Ontario.},

Meta-analysis was conducted on odds ratio (OR) and Pearson's r measures of association within unique data subgroups that were stratified by eight categories of behavioural determinants, five behavioural constructs, and two outcome types. A total of 66 relevant studies were identified. Knowledge was the most commonly investigated behavioural-determinant category (70\%), but was only associated with one of the individual behavioural constructs: prevention of cross-contamination and practicing personal hygiene (adjusted OR = 1.56; 95\% CI = 1.17, 2.06; I2 = 40\%; n = 4 studies). In contrast, attitudes and risk perceptions, the second most commonly investigated category (61\%), was significantly associated with all constructs (adjusted ORs ranging from 1.84 to 3.63) except for avoiding the consumption of risky foods. Habits, subjective norm, and measures of self-confidence and control were consistently and strongly associated with various outcomes. Behavioural intentions had inconsistent associations with behaviours, while cues to action and the high-risk health status of consumers and their families were not associated with any outcomes. Most studies (77\%) only reported measures of association that were unadjusted for confounding variables, resulting in high risk-of-bias ratings for most outcomes. Stratified analyses indicated that adjusted ORs differed from unadjusted measures.

In contrast, no association was found between food handler experience and behaviour. The findings can inform the development of targeted training initiatives for food handlers.},

  abstract = {Swimming and other recreational water activities at public beaches are popular outdoor leisure activities among Canadians. However, these activities can lead to increased risks of acquiring acute gastrointestinal illness and other illnesses among beachgoers. Young children have much higher rates of exposure and illness than other age groups. These illnesses have a significant health and economic burden on society. Climate change is expected to influence both the risk of exposure and illness. A warming climate in Canada, including more severe summer heatwave events, will likely lead to increased recreational water use. Warmer temperatures will also contribute to the growth and increased range of harmful algal blooms and other climate-sensitive pathogens. Increased precipitation and heavy rainfall events will contribute to fecal and nutrient contamination of beach waters, increasing risks of gastrointestinal illness and harmful algal bloom events. There is a need to enhance recreational water research and surveillance in Canada to prepare for and adapt to these changing risks. Key research and policy needs are suggested and discussed, including evaluating and monitoring risks of recreational water illness in Canadian contexts, improving timely reporting of recreational water quality conditions, and enhancing approaches for routine beach water surveillance.},

  abstract = {Background Up to 3\textendash 5\% of adults may be affected by food allergies, while approximately 1\% are affected by Celiac disease (CD). Food allergy reactions can be severe and potentially fatal, while CD can result in various symptoms. Restaurant and food service establishment staff have an important role in helping to prevent food allergy and CD risks among affected customers. Objectives A systematic review was undertaken to identify, characterize, and synthesize published research on the prevalence of food allergy and CD knowledge, practices, and training among restaurant and food service personnel. The population of interest included any personnel in these settings who prepare, handle, or serve food. Outcomes included the prevalence of food allergy and CD knowledge, practices, and training. Methods The review was conducted using standardized methods, including: a comprehensive search strategy; relevance screening of abstracts; characterization of relevant articles; data extraction; and risk of bias assessment. Outcomes were stratified into comparable subgroups and descriptively analyzed to examine prevalence trends across studies. Meta-regression was conducted on selected outcomes to identify possible sources of variability in prevalence estimates across studies. Results Thirty-eight relevant studies were identified; most were conducted in the United States (50\%) and focused on food allergies (90\%). Significant variability was identified across studies for most outcomes. Participants generally had a higher knowledge, self-efficacy, and use of practices related to preparing and serving allergen-free meals compared to food allergy emergency response. Participants' reported use of various risk prevention and response practices was generally low. Most participants across studies had not received prior food allergy training (median prevalence of 65\% across 12 studies). Implications Key knowledge and practice gaps were identified that could be targeted by future training programs. Research gaps were also identified, including a need for more experimental studies to evaluate food allergy and CD training interventions.},

  abstract = {Background: food handlers working in retail and food service establishments are a frequent source of foodborne disease outbreaks. Numerous studies have investigated different education and training approaches to improve their safe food handling knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Frequently, these studies use a single group, pre-post design, measuring changes before and after an intervention without a separate control group. Objectives we conducted a systematic review of these studies to identify their key characteristics and to evaluate possible predictors of between study heterogeneity in their estimates of intervention effect. Methods: the review steps included a comprehensive search; relevance screening; article characterization; risk-of-bias assessment; data extraction; and meta-regression on five outcome categories: attitudes and beliefs, knowledge, behaviours, food premise inspection scores, and aerobic plate counts. Results among 85 relevant studies identified, the most commonly investigated intervention type was in-person, group-based training courses (81\%). Interventions primarily targeted food handlers in educational institutions and restaurants (32\% and 31\%, respectively). The most frequently measured outcome was food handler knowledge (66\%). Studies mostly (89\%) covered multiple food safety content areas, primarily targeting personal hygiene (88\%) and avoiding cross-contamination (87\%). All studies were rated as `critical' risk of bias given the lack of an independent control group. Significant intervention effects were found for all outcome categories, but substantial heterogeneity was also identified. Studies that informed their intervention from formative research reported larger effect sizes for attitude and belief outcomes, those that based their intervention on a theory of behaviour change reported larger effect sizes for behaviour outcomes, and those published in grey literature sources reported larger effect sizes for behaviour and knowledge outcomes. Implications: the results of this review have identified food safety training and education research gaps and future opportunities.},

  abstract = {Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) refers to a delayed allergic reaction to galactose-{$\alpha$}-1,3-galactose ({$\alpha$}-Gal) that occurs following the consumption of mammalian meat or exposure to other animal-based foods and products. Increasing evidence suggests that bites from certain tick species can lead to AGS through sensitization of a person's {$\alpha$}-Gal specific IgE levels. This systematic review aimed to summarize the published evidence on this topic to understand post-tick exposure AGS epidemiology and health outcomes. A structured search for literature in eight bibliographic databases was conducted in January, 2020. Grey literature and verification searches were also performed. The exposure of interest was tick bites, and the outcome of interest was AGS. All primary research study designs were eligible for inclusion. References were screened for relevance, and data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment were conducted on relevant studies by two independent reviewers. Data were descriptively and narratively summarized. Of 1390 references screened, 102 relevant articles (103 unique studies) were identified (published from 2009 to 2020). Most studies (76.7\%) were case report or series. These 79 studies reported on 236 post-tick exposure AGS cases from 20 different countries, mostly the United States (33.5\%), Spain (19.5\%), Sweden (18.6\%), and France (12.7\%). The mean case age was 51.3 (SD = 16.7, range 5-85, n = 229), while 68.1\% were male (n = 226). The most commonly reported symptom was urticaria (71.2\%); 51.7\% of cases reported anaphylaxis. Twenty-one observational studies were reported, mostly (95.2\%) among clinical allergy patients. The proportion of AGS cases that recalled tick bites was highly variable across these studies. Three challenge studies evaluating tick exposures and {$\alpha$}-Gal levels in {$\alpha$}-Gal deficient mice were identified. The existing evidence suggests tick bites lead to {$\alpha$}-Gal-specific IgE sensitization, which can cause AGS, but further research is needed to clarify if AGS is only attributable to certain tick species and whether other vectors may trigger AGS. Additional research is needed on risk factors for AGS development, evaluation of diagnostic immunoassays, and the epidemiology and distribution of AGS in different populations. Climate change will likely lead to future cases of AGS in new regions worldwide due to the predicted alteration of suitable tick habitats.},
