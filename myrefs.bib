  abstract = {In Ontario, public health units collect surveillance data on vector-borne diseases (VBD) to determine emerging trends and develop VBD management strategies. Risk-assessment tools that are simple and easily applied can provide public health practitioners with objective evaluations of the risk of West Nile virus (WNV) activity in their jurisdiction. This study was conducted to evaluate an existing WNV risk-assessment tool used by a public health unit in southern Ontario. The purpose of this study was to: (i) describe the trends for WNV in mosquito and human cases in the Region of Peel, Ontario, Canada, and (ii) investigate the ability of the risk-assessment tool to predict positive human cases and positive mosquito traps in the following weeks. Data were collected from 2011 to 2016 and analysed using simple descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact tests. This study found the tool includes variables that are not significant in predicting WNV activity in the following weeks. The current tool should be revised to remove variables that are not significant in predicting risk and add additional variables that have been shown to be effective predictors in other studies, such as rainfall and human WNV cases in the previous year.},

  abstract = {Although health units have implemented food handler certification to operators of food premises, evidence on its effectiveness to improve premise food safety remains inconclusive. Regression models were constructed using inspection data from a health unit in Ontario, Canada, to measure the effect of certification on premise inspection results. We found that premises without certified food handlers at the time of inspection were significantly more likely to fail inspections. The odds of inspection failure were significantly different depending on the premise’s cultural cuisine classification. Independently owned establishments had lower odds of inspection failure versus chain operations. Inspector was a significant random effect explaining a small percentage of data variations. These results support the use of food handler certification to improve food safety outcomes at establishments. Further efforts should ensure training programs are accessible and relatable to premise operators, particularly those serving all types of cultural cuisines.},

Results from water sample analysis can take over 24-hr, which may no longer accurately reflect current water quality conditions. This study aimed to assess which combination of environmental factors best predicts fecal contamination (E. coli) levels at two of the most popular beaches on Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba (Gimli and Grand Beach), by linking water quality data and publicly available environmental data from 2007 to 2021. We developed separate mixed effects models for each beach for two outcomes, linear (continuous log-transformed E. coli concentration) and categorical (200 CFU/100 ml threshold), to explore differences in the predictors of E. coli concentrations and exceedances of the provincial health risk threshold, respectively. We used a Directed Acyclic Graph to choose which predictor variables to include in the models. For both beaches, we identified clustering of the E. coli outcomes by year, suggesting year-specific variation. We also determined that extreme weather days, with higher levels of rainfall in the preceding 48-hr, previous day average air temperature, and previous day E. coli concentration could result in a higher probability of E. coli threshold exceedances or higher concentrations in the water bodies. In Grand Beach, we identified that days with lower average UV levels in the previous 24-hr and antecedent dry days could result in a higher probability of E. coli threshold exceedances or higher concentrations. The findings can inform possible trends in other freshwater settings and be used to help develop real-time recreational water quality predictive models to allow more accurate beach management decisions and warrant enhancement of beach monitoring programs for extreme weather events as part of the climate change preparedness efforts.},

This study aimed to assess the combination of environmental factors that best predicts Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentration at public beaches in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, by combining the region’s microbial water quality data and publicly available environmental data from 2013 to 2021. We developed a Bayesian log-normal mixed-effects regression model to evaluate predictors of geometric E. coli concentrations at 15 beaches in the Metro Vancouver Region. We identified that higher levels of geometric mean E. coli levels were predicted by higher previous sample day E. coli concentrations, higher rainfall in the preceding 48~h, and higher 24-h average air temperature at the median or higher levels of the 24-h mean ultraviolet (UV) index. In contrast, higher levels of mean salinity were predicted to result in lower levels of E. coli. Finally, we determined that the average effects of the predictors varied highly by beach. Our findings could form the basis for building real-time predictive marine water quality models to enable more timely beach management decision-making.},

This cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the food safety information-seeking preferences and practices of young adults who use Reddit, a popular community-based website. A questionnaire was developed, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model and Theory of Planned Behavior, and distributed online to young adults (aged 18-39 years) from October 2019 to January 2020. Predictors of participants’ intentions to use Reddit to search for advice about safe food handling in the following two weeks were assessed in an ordinal regression model. Eligible responses were obtained from 209 individuals. One-third (36\%) of respondents had previously searched for food safety information on Reddit, 88\% of which adopted the advice they found. Self-reported food handling practices were generally positive, but only 50\% of respondents owned a food thermometer. Respondents were more likely to intend to search for food safety advice on Reddit if they perceived the website to be useful and credible, if they previously searched Reddit for food safety information, and if they perceived safe food handling to be unpleasant. Additional education and outreach strategies targeting this website are warranted to ensure accurate food safety advice is promoted online.},

Distributed lag non-linear models were constructed on ED visit counts with a Quasi Poisson distribution. Extreme precipitation was modelled as a 21-day lag variable, with a linear relationship assumed at levels ≧95th percentile. Separate models were also conducted on season-specific data sets. Daily precipitation and gastrointestinal illness ED visits ranged between 0 to 126 mm, and 12 to 180 visits respectively. Overall, a 10-mm increase in precipitation {$>$}95th percentile had no significant relationship with the risk of ED visits. However, stratification by seasons revealed significant relationships during spring (lags 1–19, peak at lag 14 RR = 1.04; 95\% CI: 1.03, 1.06); the overall cumulative effect across the 21-day lag was also significant (RR = 1.94; 95\% CI: 1.47, 2.57).

The analysis of the survey indicated that 90.4\% of the study population reported having health concerns during the pandemic while 80.3\% expressed facing financial distress. The results also show that 58.4\% of respondents experienced some form of social isolation. These all suggest that refugees are faced with several barriers which can have a compounding effect on their resettlement experience.

A scoping review of published research was prioritized to identify and characterize the scientific evidence concerning key aspects of LD to support public health efforts. Prior to initiation of this review, an expert advisory group was surveyed to solicit insight on priority topics and scope. A pre-tested search strategy implemented in eight databases (updated September 2016) captured relevant research. Pre-tested screening and data characterization forms were completed by two independent reviewers and descriptive analysis was conducted to identify topic areas with solid evidence and knowledge gaps. Of 19,353 records screened, 2,258 relevant articles were included in the review under the following six public health focus areas: a) surveillance/monitoring in North America (n=809); b) evaluation of diagnostic tests (n=736); c) risk factors (n=545); d) public health interventions (n=205); e) public knowledge, attitudes and/or perceptions in North America (n=202); and f) the economic burden of LD or cost-benefit of interventions (n=32). The majority of research investigated Borrelia burgdorferi (n=1,664), humans (n=1,154) and Ixodes scapularis (n=459). Sufficient research was identified for potential systematic reviews in four topic areas: a) accuracy of diagnostic tests; b) risk factors for human illness; c) efficacy of LD intervention strategies; and d) prevalence and/or incidence of LD in humans or B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in vertebrate reservoirs or ticks in North America. Future primary research could focus on closing knowledge gaps, such as the role of less studied vertebrate reservoirs in the transmission cycle. Results of this scoping review can be used to quickly identify and summarize relevant research pertaining to specific questions about LD or B. burgdorferi sensu lato in humans, vertebrate hosts or vectors, providing evidence-informed information within timelines that are conducive for public health decision-making.},

A thematic analysis was conducted using the Theoretical Domains Framework as a coding guide. A total of 42 consumers participated across seven focus groups. The most notable changes in behaviors were seen in participants’ hand washing, sanitation, and grocery shopping practices. Participants tended to perceive grocery store employees, shoppers, and foodservice staff as having inadequate sanitation precautions and therefore as a source of COVID-19 transmission risk. They heavily relied on public health, medical, and government officials as sources of information. Feelings of stress and anxiety appeared to be linked to certain sanitation behaviors. Many participants displayed a general apathy toward routine food safety practices, such as safe food storage at home. This research supports the need for clear and concise messaging for safe food handling during the COVID-19 pandemic and in future times of crisis.},

  abstract = {Monitoring of fecal indicator bacteria at recreational waters is an important public health measure to minimize water-borne disease, however traditional culture methods for quantifying bacteria can take 18–24 hours to obtain a result. To support real-time notifications of water quality, models using environmental variables have been created to predict indicator bacteria levels on the day of sampling. We conducted a systematic review of predictive models of fecal indicator bacteria at freshwater recreational sites in temperate climates to identify and describe the existing approaches, trends, and their performance to inform beach water management policies. We conducted a comprehensive search strategy, including five databases and grey literature, screened abstracts for relevance, and extracted data using structured forms. Data were descriptively summarized. A total of 53 relevant studies were identified. Most studies (n = 44, 83\%) were conducted in the United States and evaluated water quality using E. coli as fecal indicator bacteria (n = 46, 87\%). Studies were primarily conducted in lakes (n = 40, 75\%) compared to rivers (n = 13, 25\%). The most commonly reported predictive model-building method was multiple linear regression (n = 37, 70\%). Frequently used predictors in best-fitting models included rainfall (n = 39, 74\%), turbidity (n = 31, 58\%), wave height (n = 24, 45\%), and wind speed and direction (n = 25, 47\%, and n = 23, 43\%, respectively). Of the 19 (36\%) studies that measured accuracy, predictive models averaged an 81.0\% accuracy, and all but one were more accurate than traditional methods. Limitations identifed by risk-of-bias assessment included not validating models (n = 21, 40\%), limited reporting of whether modelling assumptions were met (n = 40, 75\%), and lack of reporting on handling of missing data (n = 37, 70\%). Additional research is warranted on the utility and accuracy of more advanced predictive modelling methods, such as Bayesian networks and artificial neural networks, which were investigated in comparatively fewer studies and creating risk of bias tools for non-medical predictive modelling.},

  abstract = {Background Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne virus transmitted by mosquitoes from the Aedes genus. The virus, endemic to parts of Asia and Africa, has recently undergone an emergence in other parts of the world where it was previously not found including Indian Ocean Islands, Europe, the Western Pacific and the Americas. There is no vaccine against chikungunya virus, which means that prevention and mitigation rely on personal protective measures and community level interventions including vector control. Methodology/Principal findings A systematic review (SR) was conducted to summarize the literature on individual and community mitigation and control measures and their effectiveness. From a scoping review of the global literature on chikungunya, there were 91 articles that investigated mitigation or control strategies identified at the individual or community level. Of these, 81 were confirmed as relevant and included in this SR. The majority of the research was published since 2010 (76.5\%) and was conducted in Asia (39.5\%). Cross sectional studies were the most common study design (36.6\%). Mitigation measures were placed into six categories: behavioural protective measures, insecticide use, public education, control of blood and blood products, biological vector control and quarantine of infected individuals. The effectiveness of various mitigation measures was rarely evaluated and outcomes were rarely quantitative, making it difficult to summarize results across studies and between mitigation strategies. Meta-analysis of the proportion of individuals engaging in various mitigation measures indicates habitat removal is the most common measure used, which may demonstrate the effectiveness of public education campaigns aimed at reducing standing water. Conclusions/Significance Further research with appropriate and consistent outcome measurements are required in order to determine which mitigation measures, or combination of mitigation measures, are the most effective at protecting against exposure to chikungunya virus.},

  abstract = {Background: Norovirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in Canada. The illness causes great morbidity and high societal costs. The objective of this article is to describe the epidemiology of norovirus in the province of Ontario, Canada from 2009 to 2014. Methods: To assess activity of norovirus and viral gastroenteritis (VGE) in Ontario, three datasets were acquired from the provincial government: two traditional surveillance datasets (outbreak and laboratory) and syndromic surveillance data (telehealth), all spanning 2009–2014. All outbreaks, laboratory submissions and telehealth calls were first assessed for total VGE. Norovirus and norovirus-like illness totals were calculated as a proportion of VGE to estimate agent-specific activity levels. Affected institution types, sexes and age groups were also analyzed. Results: Between 2009 and 2014, 41.5\% of VGE outbreaks, 63.4\% of VGE laboratory submissions and 36.6\% of all acute gastroenteritis-related (not restricted to viral causes) telehealth calls were attributed to norovirus and norovirus-like illness in Ontario. The most commonly affected institution type was long-term care homes and the most commonly affected age groups were younger (younger than five years) and older (older than 65 years) individuals. Females were slightly more frequently affected than males. Conclusion: Norovirus and norovirus-like illnesses were the leading cause of VGE in Ontario between 2009 and 2014. They comprised the greatest percentage of VGE when compared with all other VGE-associated viruses. Additional work is needed to determine all component costs and necessary public health actions to reduce the burden of disease.},

Across all other risk categories, the highest rates of infractions were observed in the “maintenance of premises, equipment and utensils” (56.7\%; n = 750). The overall item pass rate was higher in free-standing meat processing plants than abattoirs, while pass rates gradually decreased across the study period. The results of this study have identified key areas for improvement in future inspection, audit and outreach with RTE meat processing plants.},

  abstract = {Food safety deficiencies in ready-to-eat (RTE) meat processing plants can increase foodborne disease risks. The purpose of this study was to identify common deficiencies and factors related to improved food safety performance in RTE meat plants in Ontario. Routine food safety audit records for licensed provincial free-standing meat processing plants (FSMP) and abattoirs that process RTE meats were obtained and analyzed in Ontario, Canada, from 2015 to 2019. A Bayesian regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between selected plant characteristics and two outcomes: overall audit rating (pass vs. conditional pass or fail) and individual audit item fail rate. The audit rating was examined in a logistic model, while the audit item fail rate was evaluated in a negative binomial model. The majority (87.7\%, n = 800/912) of audits resulted in a pass rating (compared to conditional pass or fail). The mean number of employees per plant, among 200/204 plants with employee data available, was 11.6 (SD = 20.6, range = 1 to 200). For the logistic regression model, FSMPs were predicted to have a much higher probability of passing audits than abattoirs (32.0\% on average, with a 95\% credible interval [CI] of 13.8-52.8\%). The number of plant employees, water source (municipal vs. private), and types of RTE meat products produced had little to no consistent association with this outcome. The negative binomial model predicted a -0.009 points lower fail rate, on average, for audit items among FSMPs than abattoirs (95\% CI: -0.001, -0.018). Meat plants producing jerky had a higher audit item fail rate compared to those that did not produce such products. The other investigated variables had little to no association with this outcome. The results found in this study can support and guide future inspection, audit and outreach efforts to reduce food-borne illness risks associated with RTE meats.},

  abstract = {Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused several major epidemics globally over the last two decades and is quickly expanding into new areas. Although this mosquito-borne disease is self-limiting and is not associated with high mortality, it can lead to severe, chronic and disabling arthritis, thereby posing a heavy burden to healthcare systems. The two main vectors for CHIKV are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito); however, many other mosquito species have been described as competent CHIKV vectors in scientific literature. With climate change, globalization and unfettered urban planning affecting many areas, CHIKV poses a significant public health risk to many countries. A scoping review was conducted to collate and categorize all pertinent information gleaned from published scientific literature on a priori defined aspects of CHIKV and its competent vectors. After developing a sensitive and specific search algorithm for the research question, seven databases were searched and data was extracted from 1920 relevant articles. Results show that CHIKV research is reported predominantly in areas after major epidemics have occurred. There has been an upsurge in CHIKV publications since 2011, especially after first reports of CHIKV emergence in the Americas. A list of hosts and vectors that could potentially be involved in the sylvatic and urban transmission cycles of CHIKV has been compiled in this scoping review. In addition, a repository of CHIKV mutations associated with evolutionary fitness and adaptation has been created by compiling and characterizing these genetic variants as reported in scientific literature.},

Data for Canadian households with children (n = 294) were extracted from a larger telephone survey conducted across all Canadian provinces and territories between 2014 and 2015. Four food safety practice outcomes and six demographic variables were examined using multivariable logistics regression. Most survey participants were females (56\%) who had less than a bachelor’s degree (67\%) and were caring for one child (55\%). Approximately 90\% of caregivers reported proper hand hygiene, and 79\% refrigerated leftovers within 2 h of cooking. Only 33\% of caregivers reported preventing cross-contamination, and fewer reported using food thermometers for poultry cuts (13\%) and hamburgers (11\%). Those in the higher income and education categories were less likely to follow safe food handling practices such as hand hygiene and safe refrigeration of leftovers.

  abstract = {Purpose Students living in university residence halls often have refrigerators for food storage, and are often living alone and handling food for the first time in their lives. Therefore, an investigation of their safe food storage practices is important to help prevent food-borne illness in this population. This research seeks to evaluate the food safety knowledge, attitudes and practices related to food storage and refrigeration among undergraduate students at a university campus. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional study was conducted by administering a questionnaire to undergraduate students (n = 93) living in two residence halls on a university campus. Findings Many respondents (43.3 percent) were unaware of the maximum temperature a refrigerator should be set at to prevent microbial growth, while 83.7 percent reported ‘never’ or ‘rarely’ checking the temperature of their refrigerator using a thermometer. Many respondents (43.1 percent) incorrectly ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that the smell and appearance of food can be used as an indicator for food safety, and 64.1 percent self-reported often or always using this practice. Respondents that were born outside of Canada had more positive food storage attitudes, while those that identified as Caucasian had higher knowledge scores. A positive correlation was identified between knowledge and attitude scores (r = 0.217) but neither were significantly associated with practice scores. Originality/value The study revealed gaps in the knowledge, attitudes and practices of university students living in residence halls related to safe food storage. Hence, there is a need to increase awareness and education in this population on key food storage practices.},

  abstract = {Young children are at greater risk of foodborne illness than adults. They are affected more severely due to low stomach acid production, immature immune systems, lower body weight, and lack of control over their meal preparation. Consequently, foodborne illness disproportionately affects children, with the highest incident rate among those less than five years of age. Our goal was to synthesize evidence of food safety knowledge and behaviour of parents/caregivers who regularly prepare meals for young children at home. A comprehensive search strategy was conducted using six databases to identify relevant articles published between 1994 and 2021. Articles were screened for relevance and characterized, data extracted, and articles assessed for risk of bias. Meta-analysis of comparable outcomes was used to estimate the trend across studies. Meta-regression was conducted to explain possible sources of variability. Forty-six relevant articles were included in the meta-analysis, and there was high heterogeneity across studies and outcomes. Knowledge and behaviour gaps included participants' knowledge and use of food thermometers to check cooking doneness. Parents/caregivers across studies had high knowledge of handwashing (median prevalence of 95\%, IQR~=~90–97\%, n~=~8 studies) and practices related to discarding leftovers after 2 or more hours at room temperature (median~=~85\%, IQR~=~84–91\%, n~=~5 studies). Meta-regression results showed studies conducted in low-middle-income countries (vs. high-income countries) were more likely to report a lower prevalence of time-temperature control knowledge (β~=~−0.25; 95\%CI~=~−0.50, −0.03; I2~=~98.75\%; adj R2~=~29.3\%; n~=~11 studies) and practices related to cleaning kitchen utensils before and after meal preparation (β~=~−0.28; 95\%CI~=~−0.53, −0.03; I2~=~98.83\%; adj R2~=~18.23\%; n~=~18). Studies using self-reported behaviour measures (vs. in-person observation) tended to report a higher prevalence of handwashing with soap after handling raw meat (β~=~0.48, 95\%CI~=~0.23, 0.74; I2~=~98.34\%; adj R2~=~52\%; n~=~14). This review highlights the need for food safety interventions to target knowledge and behaviour gaps for parents of young children. Research gaps were also identified, including investigating other high-risk food consumption (e.g., cookie dough and sprout) and applying behavioural change theories to address this population's barriers to safe food handling.},

  abstract = {Bathers at public swimming pools should shower prior to entering the pool deck to remove organic material (e.g., sweat, lotions, fecal matter) that can increase the risk of recreational water illness and the formation of disinfection by-products. However, little research has been conducted to evaluate bathers’ pre-swimming showering practices. We conducted a cross-sectional study of bathers aged 18 years or older at a public swimming pool in Toronto, Ontario, to evaluate their showering habits. An in-person questionnaire was administered in October and November 2019. Bivariate associations were examined between selected variables and participants’ self-reported showering frequency prior to swimming (often or always vs. never, rarely, or sometimes). A total of 110 bathers agreed to participate. Most participants (63\%) were aged 18–34, 56\% identified as male, and 78.2\% reported always or often showering before swimming. Of these individuals, only 34\% reported using soap when showering. Participants that identified as male (vs. female) and an ethnicity other than white were more likely to report often or always showering, as were those that reported reading the pool rules and that observed other bathers taking a shower. Additional efforts are needed to educate bathers about the importance of showering prior to swimming in public pools.},

These small drinking water systems (SDWS) are diverse and face unique challenges. The purpose of this research was to explore PHIs’ insights and needs related to these SDWS in Ontario, Canada, to inform future policy and training initiatives to support safe drinking water. Data were collected through teleconference-conducted focus groups. Transcripts were analyzed and three major themes were found: the operator–PHI relationship, PHI training and information needs, and operational challenges. Overall, participants reported that they felt confident in their ability to inspect SDWSs. Main concerns to water safety were the technical ability of the water operator to manage their water supply and the impact of having a long time period between inspections of water systems. Future research should explore the cost-benefit of increasing inspection frequency in SDWSs and a variety of training and education initiatives for PHIs and operators of SDWSs.},

Though UCGs in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) of Ontario, Canada, were considered essential during the COVID-19 lockdowns and therefore open to gardeners, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food security and UCG use among garden members and managers is not fully understood. Design/methodology/approach This was an exploratory qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven managers and eight members of nine gardens in the GTA. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings The results suggest that UCGs helped participants be resilient to COVID-19 pandemic-related stressors through the provision of cultural ecosystem services. Therefore, this study supports the current literature that UCGs can help foster resilience during crises. While participants in this study did not end up being food insecure, participants did express concern about community food security. Practical implications Results contribute to the current body of literature, and can be used to further update and develop UCG policies, as well as help develop UCG infrastructure and management strategies for future crises. Originality/value The impacts of the pandemic on Canadian UCGs are not well understood. This research paper investigated the impact of the pandemic on UCG use and food security, as well as the link between UCG use and increased resilience to COVID-19-related stressors.},

  abstract = {In Ontario, potentially hazardous food that is kept hot must be held at an internal temperature of ≥ 60°C. This limits the use of infrared thermometers for food safety compliance, as they show only the surface temperature of foods. This research examined the relationship between the internal temperature of hot-held foods measured via a probe thermometer and the surface temperature measured via an infrared thermometer in a retail setting. Seven different food items in hot holding stations at seven different retail stores were examined on six occasions for probe and infrared temperatures. The data were analyzed descriptively, and a multivariable linear mixed-effects model (controlling for store location as a random effect) was developed to determine the predictive relationship of infrared to probe thermometer measurements. A strong correlation was identified between the two measurements (r = 0.706; n = 212). The regression model indicated that the infrared temperature significantly predicted the probe temperature, and this relationship differed by food type. The minimum infrared thermometer temperature needed to predict a probe temperature of ≥ 60°C, with 95\% confidence, ranged from 53°C for whole chicken to 62°C for chicken strips. These results can be used to inform temperature compliance monitoring for hot-held foods.},

We examined the relationship between specific environmental factors and E. coli concentration in recreational beaches in the Niagara Region. We analysed E. coli geometric means collected from eight beaches from two of the Great Lakes in the Niagara Region in Ontario, between 2011 and 2019. We applied path analysis to evaluate the relationship between the environmental factors and E. coli concentrations, including whether effects were direct or indirect via a mediator. Turbidity was found to be an important mediator for the indirect effect of environmental variables overall and in beach-specific models. Rainfall and streamflow had a positive indirect effect on E. coli via turbidity and a direct effect in five out of seven beach models. Streamflow was also a mediator for the indirect effect of previous day air temperature in five out of seven models. In three subset models, outfall E. coli concentration was a mediator for the effect of the environmental factors. Using a novel methodological approach, this study identifies important relationships and pathways that predict beach E. coli concentration in freshwater beaches located on two of the Great Lakes.},

This study linked environmental data to E. coli geometric means collected at 18 beaches in Toronto (2008\&ndash;2019) and the Niagara Region (2011\&ndash;2019) to examine the environmental predictors of E. coli. We developed region-specific models using mixed effects models to examine E. coli as a continuous variable and recommended thresholds of E. coli concentration (100 CFU/100 mL and 200 CFU/100 mL). Substantial clustering of E. coli values at the beach level was observed in Toronto, while minimal clustering was seen in Niagara, suggesting an important beach-specific effect in Toronto beaches. Air temperature and turbidity (measured directly or visually observed) were positively associated with E. coli in all models in both regions. In Toronto, waterfowl counts, rainfall, stream discharge and water temperature were positively associated with E. coli levels, while solar irradiance and water level were negatively associated. In Niagara, wave height and water level had a positive association with E. coli, while rainfall was negatively associated. The differences in regional models suggest the importance of a region-specific approach to addressing beach water quality. The results can guide beach monitoring and management practices, including predictive modelling.},

Study results revealed that EPHPs have faced incidents of harassment, frustration from the public, and a lack of support from management. These matters ultimately challenged the well-being of EPHPs, placing them at increased risk of burnout, stress, and fear. Thus, it is crucial that support for mental health and reporting systems is improved for the future to ensure that EPHPs are able to meet the demands of their work.

However, the content and type of mental health activities of these institutions have not been analyzed.

A 27-variable codebook was developed to map the content of all Canadian postsecondary institutions (n = 90). Descriptive statistics were applied to provide a broad snapshot of current institutional wellbeing activities. Nearly all institutions offered crisis response options, and multiple mental health supports through various modalities. However, few institutions had a wellbeing framework (34\%), engaged in recent campuswide anti-stigma campaigns (33\%), tracked campus wellness activities (13\%), monitored student mental health outcomes (13\%), and solicited feedback through the wellness center webpages (14\%). These outcomes were similar across all geographic regions but statistically significantly different between small, medium, and large institutions. Findings suggest institutions need to address these gaps, provide smaller institutions with greater governmental support for building mental health capacity, and work towards developing a centralized hub for mental health that is accessible, navigable, and considers student needs and preferences.},

The objective of this qualitative study was to apply the Theoretical Domains Framework to explore factors which influence hand hygiene among young adults aged 18 to 25\,years old. An online questionnaire (n\,=\,37) and thematic analysis were used to generate 3 overarching themes. The main findings indicated internal factors such as knowledge and intentions; interpersonal factors such as social norms; and environmental factors such as reminders, cues, accessibility, and cleanliness of handwashing facilities determined the level of hand hygiene practiced among young adults. The findings suggest that behavior change techniques such as social comparisons and tailored messaging to suit the needs of young adults may be more effective at increasing hand hygiene.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to observe the level of alcohol-based sanitizer, mask use, and physical distancing across indoor community settings in Guelph, ON, Canada, and to identify potential barriers to practicing these behaviors. Methods: Shoppers were observed in June 2022 across 21 establishments. Discrete in-person observations were conducted and electronically recorded using smartphones. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to identify possible covariates for the 3 behavioral outcomes. Results: Of 946 observed shoppers, 69\% shopped alone, 72\% had at least 1 hand occupied, 26\% touched their face, 29\% physically distanced ≥ 2 m, 6\% used hand sanitizer, and 29\% wore masks. Sanitizer use was more commonly observed among people who wore masks and in establishments with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) signage posted at the entrance. Mask use was more commonly observed during days without precipitation and in establishments with some or all touch-free entrances. Shoppers more commonly physically distanced ≥ 2 m when they were shopping alone. Conclusions: This supports evidence for environmental context influencing COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Intervention efforts aimed at visible signage, tailored messaging, and redesigning spaces to facilitate preventive behaviors may be effective at increasing adherence during outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Qualitative research studies make up only a small portion of all publications in the food disciplines. Despite this, these approaches have offered an in-depth understanding of several food safety and food security problems over the last few decades. However, there continues to be inadequate reporting of qualitative research specific to food contexts, which results in a lack of transparency, rigour, questioning the credibility of qualitative approaches, and challenges in its uptake and synthesis. Several reviews of qualitative evidence in food safety have found reporting to be lacking in the following areas: study title, philosophical orientation, study design, researcher reflexivity, ethical approval, and qualitative analysis. In this paper, we describe the primary hurdles new qualitative researchers face in conducting and reporting research, and present practical solutions to complex qualitative challenges. For permanent and widespread changes aimed at advancing qualitative evidence in the food disciplines, we call on food educators to integrate qualitative methods training in research-based programs; journals and reviewers to appraise qualitative studies using established reporting guidelines; and appeal to academic publishers to expand current word limits to facilitate reporting of all important aspects of qualitative research.},

Qualitative research studies have explored how these measures and other environmental influences shape preventive behaviours. The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize previously published qualitative research, generate across-study themes, and propose recommendations for behaviour change interventions. We used a comprehensive search strategy, relevance screening and confirmation, data extraction, quality assessment, thematic synthesis, and quality-of-evidence assessment. In total, 87 relevant studies were identified. Findings were grouped under six overarching themes and mapped under three categories: (i) the political environment, (ii) the sociocultural environment, and (iii) the physical environment.

  abstract = {Older adults are a high-risk population for foodborne illness because of weakened immune systems, chronicillnesses, and a resulting increased likelihood of complications. A systematic review was undertaken to identify,characterize, and synthesize the published research on the food safety knowledge and behaviors of older adults(60+) in the domestic setting. The review consisted of a comprehensive search strategy, relevance screening,article characterization, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment. Outcomes were analyzed using meta-re-gression to explain variance in prevalence estimates across studies. Fifty-seven relevant studies published be-tween 1996 and 2018 were identified. Knowledge gaps included older adults' awareness ofListeria(median = 40\%; range = 33–58\%; n = 5 studies), and knowledge on the safe operating temperatures of re-frigerators (median = 43\%; range = 12–65\%; n = 11 studies). Older consumers reported refrigerating leftoverswithin 2 h of cooking, with an average prevalence of 87\% (95\%CI = 0.86–0.88; I2= 0\%; n = 7 studies). Of thehigh-risk foods, older adults consumed undercooked eggs most often (median = 33\%, range = 8\%–50\%, n = 8studies). Meta-regression explained the across-study variability in prevalence of handwashing before food pre-paration, where self-report measures reported a higher prevalence than in-person observations (β= 0.66;CI = 0.49–0.83; I2= 82.3\%; adj. R2= 97.8\%, n = 10 studies). Future training programs should target knowl-edge gaps identified in this review.},

  abstract = {Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to apply the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to determine which psychosocial factors are predictors of older adults' safe food storage practices at home. Design/methodology/approach-An online structured questionnaire was developed and administered to older adults (60+). Two behavioural intention outcomes were investigated: thawing meats safely and storing leftovers within recommended guidelines. The survey instrument measured socio-demographic and TPB variables: attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and intentions. A measure of self-reported habitual behaviour was also recorded and used to determine whether past practice influenced behavioural intentions. Findings-Respondents (n = 78) demonstrated good intentions to safely defrost meats and store leftovers. The models accounted for 41 and 48 per cent of the variance in intentions to perform safe storage behaviours. Attitudes and subjective norms were predictors of intentions to safely thaw meats. Habitual behaviour was a significant predictor of behavioural intentions to safely store leftovers. Perceived behavioural control was a significant predictor of intentions to thaw meats and store leftovers. Research limitations/implications-The sample size was small, and results are to be interpreted with caution. Practical implications-The results indicate that theory-based solutions to solving food safety among consumers may be a feasible strategy. Originality/value-The study is the first of its kind to apply the TPB to this consumer group.},

Older adults are at increased risk for foodborne illness because of their decline in immune function and gut function, as well as underlying chronic conditions. In this study, a subset of previously collected survey data was analyzed to identify potential determinants related to safe storage and temperature control food safety practices among seniors at home. Data from seniors across Canada (n = 1078) were collected in 2014-2015, using a population-based, structured telephone survey. Three safe food-handling outcomes and nine determinants were examined, using logistic regression models. Most participants were women (66\%) and lived with others (51\%). Most seniors followed instructions on food labels (90\%) and refrigerated leftovers within recommended guidelines (82\%), but only a small proportion of respondent's stored raw meats on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator (20\%). Models revealed that women and younger seniors (65-74) were more likely than men and older seniors to have better food handling outcomes. Recommendations are provided based on these findings to improve targeted messaging and highlight areas for future research among seniors.},

  abstract = {Background: The Publicly Available International Foodborne Outbreak Database (PAIFOD) is a regularly updated repository that contains international outbreak data collected from multiple surveillance systems and sources. As of February 2020, the database contained more than 13,000 entries spanning over 20 years. PAIFOD is the only known database that captures international foodborne outbreak data. Objective: To explore user perceptions and identify potential directions for PAIFOD and make recommendations for databases with food safety information. Methods: Between January and March 2020, 16 semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 24 previous, current and potential PAIFOD users. Interviewees were asked about their knowledge of and experience of using PAIFOD as well as about its strengths and limitations and recommendations for the database. An inductive thematic analysis approach was used to analyze qualitative data and generate themes. Results: Four main themes were generated based on the 24 interviewees’ accounts of their experience with and recommendations for PAIFOD: participants viewed PAIFOD as a useful tool; they weren’t familiar with its contents or purpose; they stated it should become an open-access platform or linked with another information-sharing initiative; and they considered that PAIFOD had the potential to enhance the Agency’s reputation by becoming widely recognized and used. Conclusion: This work, along with the ever-changing landscape of foodborne surveillance, supports the need to ensure that PAIFOD is updated to meet the modern-day demands of food safety experts.},

  abstract = {Background: Vaccines are effective biological interventions which reduce health burdens and protect healthcare providers from vaccine-preventable diseases. However, there are concerns about varying levels of vaccination coverage of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines among those working in healthcare. The aim of this study was to identify barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations among healthcare providers and trainees using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Methods: Semi-structured interviews (n = 18) were carried out with healthcare providers and trainees in Canada. A thematic analysis approach was used to code interview transcripts and match findings to TDF domains and broader categories. Results: Three overarching themes were generated from six TDF domains and three inductively generated categories: (1) making informed health decisions with an added responsibility to protect oneself and patients; (2) a pro-vaccine social network, widespread accessibility, and pursuing a sense of normalcy; and (3) seeking a more nuanced, respectful, and calculated approach to vaccine communication and policy implementation. Conclusion: These findings help to identify factors associated with influenza and COVID-19 vaccine uptake among individuals in the healthcare field. Addressing these factors may improve healthcare provider sentiments surrounding vaccines, lead to better patient education, and increased uptake of vaccinations with the potential for seasonal booster doses.

  abstract = {Foodborne disease outbreaks are frequently associated with improper food handling at retail and food service settings, indicating a need to improve food safety practices among food handlers. Many qualitative research studies have been conducted to examine food handlers' opinions, perspectives, and experiences with safe food handling in an effort to understand the factors associated with their use of such practices. The aim of this systematic review was a synthesis of the findings from relevant studies to identify the main across-study themes and develop recommendations for interventions and future research. The following steps used to conduct the review were developed a priori as part of the study protocol: a comprehensive search strategy; relevance screening of abstracts; relevance confirmation of articles; study quality assessment; data extraction; thematic synthesis of results; and quality-of-evidence assessment. We identified 28 relevant articles reporting on 26 unique studies. Behavioural determinants were grouped according to constructs from the Theoretical Domain Framework, and further mapped onto the COM-B model of the Behaviour Change Wheel. A total of 13 categories of determinants of safe food handling were identified. Of these categories, overall confidence ratings were assigned and rated as high (n = 9) and moderate (n = 4). The analysis revealed that: 1) food handlers typically demonstrated good knowledge and had positive attitudes toward training; 2) environmental factors (e.g. policies, resources), reinforcement (e.g. posters, reminders), emotions (e.g. stress), and social influences played a significant role in food handlers' intentions and practices; 3) food handlers were confident in their abilities and showed positive beliefs relating to consequences of unsafe food handling; 4) they demonstrated a lack of motivation to perform safe food handling practices and experienced lapses in concentration; and 5) culturally diverse food handlers had unique barriers such as language and communication. Areas for future research and recommendations for policy and practice are discussed.},

  abstract = {Context: Consumption of lean fish and fish-derived proteins were effective for improving lipid profiles in published studies; however, evidence remains inconclusive. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of lean fish or fish-derived protein on serum/plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels by conducting a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data sources: Medline (Ovid), Scopus, CINAHL, and Food and Nutritional Sciences databases were searched from the start date of each database to September 2019 to identify RCTs determining the effect of lean fish on lipid profile. Study selection included: RCTs investigated lean fish and fish-derived proteins intake and determined at least 1 major lipid or lipoprotein measurement. Data extraction: Two reviewers independently evaluated 1217 studies against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Relevant studies were assessed for risks of bias, and random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to generate average estimates of effect. Results: A total of 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of data from 18 to 21 eligible crossover and parallel-design RCTs with a total of 1392 to 1456 participants found triacylglycerol-lowering effects for lean fish compared with no fish consumption. Lean fish intake showed no significant differences related to total cholesterol or lipoprotein levels. Subanalysis showed that parallel-group RCTs tended to find greater reduction effects on circulating triacylglycerol than did crossover RCTs. Conclusion: Additional better-designed, longer, and larger RCTs, particularly crossover RCTs, are needed to clarify the impact of lean fish and fish proteins on the serum/plasma lipid profile. Findings from such studies would enable practitioners to provide their patients evidence-based recommendations to meet the American Heart Association guidelines for fish consumption to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.},

Therefore, we conducted a study to analyze produce washing messaging in YouTube videos posted during, compared to prior to, the COVID-19 pandemic. Videos were identified via targeted keyword searches. Produce washing methods were coded and classified according to government recommendations. A total of 100 YouTube videos were identified and analyzed; 66 videos were posted during the pandemic and 34 before the pandemic. Of the 100 videos, 70 contained nonfactual information about produce washing. Videos posted by bloggers were more likely to contain nonfactual information compared to videos posted by the government and organizations (78 versus 29\%). Videos posted during the pandemic were more likely to have nonfactual information than those posted before the pandemic (56 versus 17\%). This study found that individual bloggers contributed to the spread of misinformation about produce washing in YouTube videos, resulting in potentially harmful behavior changes among consumers.

  abstract = {Abstract Cache Valley virus (CVV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus detected throughout North America, Central America and parts of South America. A limited number of human case reports have described severe illness. CVV infection has been associated with outbreaks of congenital defects in small ruminants in Canada and the United States. A scoping review was conducted to identify, characterize and summarize research on CVV, and to identify research gaps. A structured search was conducted in eight electronic databases, with additional search verification and grey literature investigation. All captured studies were independently appraised by two reviewers for relevance and data characterization. The review captured 143 relevant studies investigating CVV epidemiology (n = 104), pathogenesis (n = 37), viral characteristics (n = 24), transmission (n = 14), diagnostic test performance (n = 8) and mitigation strategies (n = 2). Evidence of CVV infection was found in mosquito studies (n = 47), and serological evidence of exposure was demonstrated in animals (n = 41), as well as human (n = 20) studies. In sheep, five outbreaks of birth defects following asymptomatic dam CVV infection during the first 50 days of pregnancy were reported. Only six human cases of CVV-associated illness were captured, with case symptoms described as initially non-specific, progressing to more severe clinical signs (e.g., meningitis). No research was identified investigating treatment, societal knowledge and risk perception, economic burden or predictive models related to the impact of climate change on CVV. CVV circulates in mosquito and animal species across a large area of the Americas. Small ruminants are the only animals in which CVV-associated clinical disease has been extensively studied. It is likely that human cases are under-reported or misdiagnosed. Future research should focus on the impact of CVV infection in human and animal populations.},

  abstract = {Background Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has commonly been associated with large waterborne outbreaks of human jaundice in endemic areas but it has been increasingly recognised as a cause of sporadic human cases of jaundice in non-endemic areas, in individuals with no history of travel. Zoonotic exposure is widely hypothesized to be an important potential transmission route in these sporadic human cases. Serosurveys conducted to determine the frequency of HEV human exposure report wide ranges in prevalence across studies and locations. Our study objective was to compute meta-analysis summary estimates of human seroprevalence of HEV IgG within countries considered HEV non-endemic, where possible, and to determine whether this varied significantly across these countries, as well as investigating the role of potential HEV seroprevalence predictors such as population age structure. Materials and methods A broad literature search was conducted in six electronic databases. Citations were appraised, and relevant data extracted using forms designed and pre-tested a priori. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted in R, with HEV IgG seroprevalence in blood donors or the general population being the outcome of interest, and country, assay, population age and sex structure, and chronological time investigated as predictors of the outcome. Results From 4163 unique citations initially captured, data were extracted from 135 studies investigating HEV serology in blood donors or the general population, of 31 countries among those categorised as ‘very high human development’ by the United Nations. Country of sampling and assay employed were consistently significant predictors of HEV IgG seroprevalence with chronological time being a non-significant predictor in the dataset of captured studies. Conclusions While country of sampling and assay employed were significant predictors of HEV seroprevalence, comparison of HEV seroprevalence across non-endemic countries is hampered by the lack of a gold standard assay and uncertainty regarding residual bias across studies, as well as regional differences within some countries.},

  abstract = {Swimming in public pools can expose bathers to microbiological (e.g., Cryptosporidium) and chemical (e.g., disinfection by-product) hazards, which can lead to recreational water illness. Adequate hygienic behaviours among bathers are important to reduce these risks. However, prior studies have found low compliance with pre-swim showering and avoidance of urinating in pools. We conducted a mixed-methods analysis of online discussion comments to identify key determinants of these two behaviours. We identified relevant discussion threads on Reddit, Quora, and swimming forums. Identified comments were classified as having a positive or negative sentiment towards the behaviour, and they were thematically analyzed according to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). We analyzed 986 comments from 45 threads; 49.8\% of comments were classified as expressing a positive sentiment towards the behaviour. Positive sentiments were more commonly expressed towards pre-swim showering compared to avoidance of urinating in pools (60.1 vs. 47.1\%). Eleven themes were identified across the following eight TDF domains: beliefs about consequences (n=362 comments), social influences (n=298), beliefs about capabilities (n=240), social/professional role and identity (n=144), knowledge (n=138), emotions (n=137), reinforcement (n=78), and environmental context and resources (n=33). Results can help to inform targeted educational and outreach strategies with bathers to encourage increased adoption of hygienic behaviours.},

  abstract = {Previous surveys have found that few Canadians report using a food thermometer to check cooking doneness, and many report rinsing or washing poultry prior to cooking. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted to investigate the sociodemographic and psychosocial determinants of the reported use of these behaviors among Canadians. A questionnaire was developed, guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework, and pre-tested through 10 cognitive interviews. The questionnaire was administered in English and French on November 18, 2019, to an online panel of 524 Canadian consumers. Logistic and ordinal regression models were constructed to evaluate determinants of consumers’ reported thermometer ownership (yes/no) and thermometer use and poultry washing frequencies (each measured on a 5-point Likert scale). Nearly two-thirds of respondents (64\%; n=333) reported owning a food thermometer. Thermometer ownership was more common among males (odds ratio [OR]=1.48, 95\% CI=1.02, 2.15) and those with higher income categories. Nearly 45\% of these respondents (n=147) reported often or always using their thermometer to check cooking doneness. The frequency of engaging in this behavior was best determined by four psychosocial constructs: behavioral intentions, beliefs about consequences, self-efficacy, and habits. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (64\%; n=333) reported often or always washing their poultry before cooking it. This behavior was more frequently reported by males (OR=1.51, 95\% CI=1.002, 2.28). It was also predicted by six psychosocial constructs: behavioral intentions, beliefs about consequences, self-efficacy, social influences, social responsibility, and habits. Habits had the largest influence on both behaviors. The study results can inform the development of more targeted food safety education and outreach initiatives to improve these behaviors among Canadians.},

  abstract = {Improper food handling among those working in retail and food service settings is a frequent contributor to foodborne illness outbreaks. Food safety training and education interventions are important strategies to improve the behaviors and behavioral precursors (e.g., knowledge and attitudes) of food handlers in these settings. We conducted a comprehensive systematic review to identify, characterize, and synthesize global studies in this area to determine the overall effectiveness of these interventions. The review focused on experimental studies with an independent control group. Review methods included structured search strategy, relevance screening of identified abstracts, characterization of relevant articles, risk of bias assessment, data extraction, meta-analysis of intervention effectiveness for four outcome categories (attitudes, knowledge, behavior, and food premise inspection scores), and a quality of evidence assessment. We identified 18 relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 29 nonrandomized trials. Among RCTs, 25 (64\%) unique outcomes were rated as high risk of bias, primarily owing to concerns about outcome measurement methods, while 45 (98\%) nonrandomized trial outcomes were rated as serious risk of bias, primarily because of concerns about confounding bias. High confidence was identified for the effect of training and education interventions to improve food handler knowledge outcomes in eight RCT studies (standardized mean difference = 0.92; 95\% confidence interval: 0.03, 1.81; I 2 = 86\%). For all other outcomes, no significant effect was identified. In contrast, nonrandomized trials identified a statistically significant positive intervention effect for all outcome types, but confidence in these findings was very low due to possible confounding and other biases. Results indicate that food safety training and education interventions are effective to improve food handler knowledge, but more evidence is needed on strategies to improve behavior change.},

  abstract = {The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in major disruptions to the food service industry and regulatory food inspections. The objective of this study was to conduct an interrupted time series analysis to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food safety inspection trends in Toronto, Canada. Inspection data for restaurants and take-out establishments were obtained from 2017 to 2022 and summarized as weekly counts of inspections, pass ratings, and total infractions. Bayesian segmented regression was conducted to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on weekly infraction and inspection pass rates. On average, a 0.31-point lower weekly infraction rate (95\% credible interval [CI]: 0.23, 0.40) and a 2.0\% higher probability of passing inspections (95\% CI: 1.1\%, 3.0\%) were predicted in the pandemic period compared to pre-pandemic. Models predicted lower infraction rates and higher pass rates immediately following the pandemic, with additional variability compared to the pre-pandemic period, that were regressing back toward pre-pandemic levels in 2022. Seasonal effects were also identified, with infraction rates highest in April and pass rates lowest in August. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an initial positive effect on food safety outcomes in restaurants and take-out food establishments in Toronto, but this effect appears to be temporary. This finding could be due to the beneficial impact of COVID-19 protection measures in these establishments or other factors such as less volume of customers. Additional research is needed to investigate causes of the identified differences as well as seasonal and long-term inspection trends post-pandemic. Results can inform future food safety inspection planning, outreach, and pandemic preparedness.},

  abstract = {Farmers' markets are increasingly popular food venues in Canada. However, they have unique food safety challenges due to their operational characteristics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the food safety behaviours of farmers' market vendors in the Greater Toronto Area of Ontario, Canada, to identify possible food safety risks and areas for future education and training. The food safety behaviours of vendors selling time-temperature control for safety (TCS) foods were observed throughout 2018 at 60 markets. Observations were conducted discretely and recorded on a standardized form via a smartphone. Data were descriptively analysed, and two selected outcomes were evaluated in multivariable logistic regression models. Prepared foods (50\%) were the most commonly sold type of TCS food product among all observed vendors (n = 454). While general cleanliness and sanitation was very high, 27\% of vendors did not provide cross-contamination protection methods for at least some of their TCS foods. Similarly, 66\% and 48\% of vendors who sold foods requiring cold and hot holding (n = 410 and 162, respectively) did not provide temperature control for at least some of their foods. Cold-holding temperature control was more commonly observed among vendors selling raw meat, poultry, and fish, and less commonly observed among those selling ready-to-eat meats; fresh-cut leafy green vegetables, tomatoes, and melons; and cheese and dairy products. A mean of 4.55 (SD = 2.62) behaviours requiring handwashing was observed per vendor across 1356 customer transactions, but only 2.9\% of vendors attempted handwashing. Most vendors handled food with their bare hands on at least one occasion (79\%); this behaviour was more commonly observed at weekend markets and among vendors engaged in multiple roles, and less commonly observed among vendors selling prepared foods. The study results have identified targeted areas for future food safety education and training with farmers’ markets vendors in Ontario.},

  abstract = {Background Swimming and other recreational water activities in surface waters are popular in Canada during the summer. However, these activities can also increase the risk of recreational water illness. While routine monitoring of beach water quality is conducted by local authorities each summer, little research is available in Canada about beach exposures and illness risks. Methods We conducted a pilot of a prospective cohort study at a popular beach in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 2022 to determine characteristics of beachgoers, common water and sand exposures, the incidence of recreational water illness, and the feasibility for a larger, national cohort study. We enrolled beachgoers on-site and surveyed about their exposures at the beach and conducted a follow-up survey 7 days following their beach visit to ascertain acute gastrointestinal, respiratory, skin, ear, and eye illness outcomes. We descriptively tabulated and summarized the collected data. Results We enrolled 649 households, consisting of 831 beachgoers. Water contact activities were reported by 56\% of beachgoers, with swimming being the most common activity (44\% of participants). Similarly, 56\% of beachgoers reported digging in the sand or burying themselves in the sand. Children (≤14 years) and teenagers (15–19 years) were most likely to report engaging in water contact activities and swallowing water, while children were most likely to report sand contact activities and getting sand in their mouth. Boys and men were more likely than women and girls to report swallowing water (15.2\% vs. 9.4\%). Water and sand exposures also differed by household education level and participant ethno-racial identity. E. coli levels in beach water were consistently low (median = 20 CFU/100 mL, range = 10–58). The incidence of illness outcomes was very low (0.3–2.8\%) among the 287 participants that completed the follow-up survey. Conclusions The identified beach exposure patterns can inform future risk assessments and communication strategies. Excellent water quality was observed at the studied beach, likely contributing to the low incidence of illnesses. A larger, national cohort study is needed in Canada to examine risks of illness at beaches at higher risk of fecal contamination.},

  abstract = {Swimming and other recreational water activities at public beaches are popular outdoor leisure activities among Canadians. However, these activities can lead to increased risks of acquiring acute gastrointestinal illness and other illnesses among beachgoers. Young children have much higher rates of exposure and illness than other age groups. These illnesses have a significant health and economic burden on society. Climate change is expected to influence both the risk of exposure and illness. A warming climate in Canada, including more severe summer heatwave events, will likely lead to increased recreational water use. Warmer temperatures will also contribute to the growth and increased range of harmful algal blooms and other climate-sensitive pathogens. Increased precipitation and heavy rainfall events will contribute to fecal and nutrient contamination of beach waters, increasing risks of gastrointestinal illness and harmful algal bloom events. There is a need to enhance recreational water research and surveillance in Canada to prepare for and adapt to these changing risks. Key research and policy needs are suggested and discussed, including evaluating and monitoring risks of recreational water illness in Canadian contexts, improving timely reporting of recreational water quality conditions, and enhancing approaches for routine beach water surveillance.},

Objectives A systematic review was undertaken to identify, characterize, and synthesize published research on the prevalence of food allergy and CD knowledge, practices, and training among restaurant and food service personnel. The population of interest included any personnel in these settings who prepare, handle, or serve food. Outcomes included the prevalence of food allergy and CD knowledge, practices, and training. Methods The review was conducted using standardized methods, including: a comprehensive search strategy; relevance screening of abstracts; characterization of relevant articles; data extraction; and risk of bias assessment. Outcomes were stratified into comparable subgroups and descriptively analyzed to examine prevalence trends across studies. Meta-regression was conducted on selected outcomes to identify possible sources of variability in prevalence estimates across studies. Results Thirty-eight relevant studies were identified; most were conducted in the United States (50\%) and focused on food allergies (90\%). Significant variability was identified across studies for most outcomes. Participants generally had a higher knowledge, self-efficacy, and use of practices related to preparing and serving allergen-free meals compared to food allergy emergency response. Participants’ reported use of various risk prevention and response practices was generally low. Most participants across studies had not received prior food allergy training (median prevalence of 65\% across 12 studies). Implications Key knowledge and practice gaps were identified that could be targeted by future training programs. Research gaps were also identified, including a need for more experimental studies to evaluate food allergy and CD training interventions.},

Methods: the review steps included a comprehensive search; relevance screening; article characterization; risk-of-bias assessment; data extraction; and meta-regression on five outcome categories: attitudes and beliefs, knowledge, behaviours, food premise inspection scores, and aerobic plate counts. Results among 85 relevant studies identified, the most commonly investigated intervention type was in-person, group-based training courses (81\%). Interventions primarily targeted food handlers in educational institutions and restaurants (32\% and 31\%, respectively). The most frequently measured outcome was food handler knowledge (66\%). Studies mostly (89\%) covered multiple food safety content areas, primarily targeting personal hygiene (88\%) and avoiding cross-contamination (87\%). All studies were rated as ‘critical’ risk of bias given the lack of an independent control group. Significant intervention effects were found for all outcome categories, but substantial heterogeneity was also identified. Studies that informed their intervention from formative research reported larger effect sizes for attitude and belief outcomes, those that based their intervention on a theory of behaviour change reported larger effect sizes for behaviour outcomes, and those published in grey literature sources reported larger effect sizes for behaviour and knowledge outcomes. Implications: the results of this review have identified food safety training and education research gaps and future opportunities.},

  abstract = {Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) refers to a delayed allergic reaction to galactose-α-1,3-galactose (α-Gal) that occurs following the consumption of mammalian meat or exposure to other animal-based foods and products. Increasing evidence suggests that bites from certain tick species can lead to AGS through sensitization of a person’s α-Gal specific IgE levels. This systematic review aimed to summarize the published evidence on this topic to understand post-tick exposure AGS epidemiology and health outcomes. A structured search for literature in eight bibliographic databases was conducted in January, 2020. Grey literature and verification searches were also performed. The exposure of interest was tick bites, and the outcome of interest was AGS. All primary research study designs were eligible for inclusion. References were screened for relevance, and data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment were conducted on relevant studies by two independent reviewers. Data were descriptively and narratively summarized. Of 1390 references screened, 102 relevant articles (103 unique studies) were identified (published from 2009 to 2020). Most studies (76.7\%) were case report or series. These 79 studies reported on 236 post-tick exposure AGS cases from 20 different countries, mostly the United States (33.5\%), Spain (19.5\%), Sweden (18.6\%), and France (12.7\%). The mean case age was 51.3 (SD = 16.7, range 5-85, n = 229), while 68.1\% were male (n = 226). The most commonly reported symptom was urticaria (71.2\%); 51.7\% of cases reported anaphylaxis. Twenty-one observational studies were reported, mostly (95.2\%) among clinical allergy patients. The proportion of AGS cases that recalled tick bites was highly variable across these studies. Three challenge studies evaluating tick exposures and α-Gal levels in α-Gal deficient mice were identified. The existing evidence suggests tick bites lead to α-Gal-specific IgE sensitization, which can cause AGS, but further research is needed to clarify if AGS is only attributable to certain tick species and whether other vectors may trigger AGS. Additional research is needed on risk factors for AGS development, evaluation of diagnostic immunoassays, and the epidemiology and distribution of AGS in different populations. Climate change will likely lead to future cases of AGS in new regions worldwide due to the predicted alteration of suitable tick habitats.},
